As it is tradition, the Great Tengu, lead by their lord Tenma and supervised by Megumu Iizunamaru, express feudal demands to the speaker of the lower caste and collect their resources for Tenma's gains. In recent times though, the demands of Tenma have turned more and more unreasonable. Despite all of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s best efforts, the lower caste has not been able to meet the demands. In an act of outrage and wrath Tenma ordered the forceful imprisonment and execution of [Root.Monarch.GetName] and all those who follow [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim].\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] has escaped the hostile Great Tengu barely and news of Tenma's curelty have reached every corner of [Root.GetName].

Instead of ruling the country on his own he appointed a spokesman for the Low Tengu caste to supervise the state while also fulfilling the egoistical demands of Tenma. All while the Great Tengu caste lived on the costs of the Low Tengu.\n\nAs the revolution struck [Root.GetName] the pitiful chief of the Tengu is nothing but a shell of his former glory. Too obese to fly, too pathetic to defend himself when the combined forces of Crow and Wolf Tengu charged his office. Tenma was arrested and stood trial before Aya, Hatate and Momiji, the great leaders of the revolutionl. The verdict is clear: eternal banishment."

And now they seek refuge here at [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s humble mansion in the Bamboo Forest! They promise that all the past deeds of Kaguya are forgiven if the Watatsuki sisters get asylum here."
 TH_lunarian_events.15.a: "You have nerves to appear here... well then, I think you can stay here."
 TH_lunarian_events.15.b: "*Kicks the sisters out of the mansion*"
 ###EVENTS FOR HKR###
 flavor_hkr.2.t: "The many supporters of [Root.GetName]"
 flavor_hkr.2.desc: "Reimu made many friends over the years, most of them through solving the incidents. Of course these friends are ready to help Reimu in times of need, but sadly, Reimu's abilities to handle them all is limited - like right now. If she wants to take the full advantage of the support, she has to decide whose help she can keep."
 flavor_hkr.2.a: "Remilia, I let you go back to the mansion."
 flavor_hkr.2.b: "Yuyuko, Netherworld is calling for you again."
 flavor_hkr.2.c: "Kaguya, it was fun, but the Bamboo Forest needs you."
 flavor_hkr.2.d: "Sanae, just get out of my sight you fun heretic."
 flavor_hkr.3.a.tt: "Every [Root.Religion.GetName] nation who is not allied to [HVR.GetName] will have an increased opinion of §G100§! to us."
 flavor_hkr.4.t: "Suika returns!"
 flavor_hkr.4.desc: "A whole week has passed and Suika is yet again at the Hakurei Shrine: this time even with proof that she truly was in Hell (she shows Eiki's stamp on her hand) and Heaven (she holds a torn out piece of Tenshi's clothes) and now she wishes for the sake. Reimu gives her the sake reluctantly and after a while, Suika becomes completely drunk...\nThe next morning, more chaos can be found at the shrine. As an apology, Suika offers her service for the [Root.GovernmentName]."
 flavor_hkr.4.a: "Well, her powers could be quite useful at the front."
 flavor_hkr.4.a.tt: "Suika Ibuki will become a general for our realm, which can be recruited every 30 - 60 years."
 flavor_hkr.4.b: "She could teach the other shrine maidens of how to fight in melee combat."
 flavor_hkr.4.b.tt: "Suika will remain in the training fields and won't be a general in our service."
 flavor_hkr.5.t: "A horned Shrine Maiden"
 flavor_hkr.5.desc: "Suika has been a long resident of the Hakurei Shrine for quite some time. Due to this, she enjoys a high trust from Reimu.\nWhile Reimu is a competent shrine maiden, she knows that her days are limited due to being a mortal so she is considering declaring Suika to the official heir of [Root.GetName]..."
 flavor_hkr.5.a: "On the other hand, I think it's not a great idea."
 flavor_hkr.5.a.tt: "Suika will remain to be only a resident of the Hakurei Shrine."
 flavor_hkr.5.b: "You will make a great apprentice, Suika."
 flavor_hkr.5.c: "You know what, I am in an age for retirement anyway."
 flavor_hkr.6.t: "Suika the Oni Miko"
 flavor_hkr.6.desc: "The time has come! Reimu has decided to retire and let the new Oni Shrine Maiden - Suika Ibuki - become the next shrine maiden! These are exciting news as never before was the Hakurei Shrine lead by somebody other than a human!\n\nUnlike Reimu, Suika is an oni, who honors strength, loyalty and honesty. Because of this reason, the last thing an oni would do would be ignoring a Call to Arms or an invasion from the Outworld!"
 flavor_hkr.6.a: "Long live Suika!"
 flavor_hkr.6.a.tt: "Suika will no longer help the army as a general or as a trainer.\n\n§TSuika Ibuki is a ruler of honesty. In case of refusing a Call to Arms, Suika will perform sub optimally as a ruler for some time.§!"
 flavor_hkr.7.t: "Wounded Oni Honor!"
 flavor_hkr.7.desc: "For an oni nothing is holier than strength and honesty - especially the latter, which brings [Root.Monarch.GetName] to a dilemma as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had to refuse a call to arms. Something, which no oni would allow themselves to ever do! Due to this [Root.Monarch.GetName] is suffering quite a heavy burden on her shoulders until enough time has passed for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to forget."
 flavor_hkr.7.a: "Dishonorable..."
 flavor_hkr.8.t: "Weaponized Poverty"
 flavor_hkr.8.desc: "It was not easy but after some convincing, Reimu managed to send Shion to our rival to pay them a little visit. Just how our Shrine Maiden expected, Shion's presence caused for a massive financial crisis in there!\nHowever, Shion noted that she prefers to not be used like that in the future and wants to help us by making loan sharks go bankrupt instead."
 flavor_hkr.8.a: "Don't forget the normal bank neither, Shion."
 flavor_hkr.9.t: "Shion's Visit"
 flavor_hkr.9.desc: "Usually it is a good sign when a god visits the throne of a country. But not today! [Root.Monarch.GetName] must have gotten the unluckiest day in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] life: Shion Yorigami, the Goddess of Poverty, crashed into the court and through that a crack in the treasury has been caused. Through that a lot of our Ducats vanished into oblivion!"
 flavor_hkr.9.a: "Accursed goddess..."
 flavor_hkr.9.a.tt: "Luckily [Root.Monarch.GetName] is a wise ruler and had hired a guard, who keeps an eye on the vault of the treasury. When the Shion incident happened, the guard noticed where our precious gold went and collected it all for our realm. Because of that he gets a gift of 10 Ducats."
 flavor_hkr.102.t: "Reimu and the Incidents"
 flavor_hkr.102.desc: "Reimu Hakurei is technically just a normal human girl - she might have some strange, magical powers and the job of shrine maiden, but she is still a normal girl. However, due to her importance in Gensokyo's history, the Hakurei deity decided to transfer some of its powers to Reimu to ensure that her life will be long enough to take care of the many incidents Gensokyo will see in the future."
 flavor_hkr.102.a: "I will do my best."
 flavor_hkr.102.a.tt: "§YReimu is Immortal until the final incident is solved§!."
 flavor_hkr.103.t: "Reimu retires"
 flavor_hkr.103.desc: "With the resolution of the final incident, the powers, which were given by the Hakurei deity, faded away - and Reimu reached a considerably high age...\nHowever, Reimu will not die to age. Instead, she is planning to retire and call it a death so everyone in Gensokyo would leave her alone."
 flavor_hkr.103.a: "I sure as hell deserve retirement."
 flavor_hkr.10.t: "Punishment of a Celestial"
 flavor_hkr.10.desc: "Celestials are, in general, peaceful people who enjoy a life without any worries in Heaven and tend to be quite humble. However, Tenshi is the big exception: she is regularly bored of Heaven and travels down to Gensokyo to cause chaos and destruction - just for her pure enjoyment.\nHowever, this finally found its end as Suika traveled to Heaven and had her fun with Tenshi. As a result of this many Gensokyans are more than happy that finally someone brought justice upon Tenshi."
 flavor_hkr.10.a: "I just hope Tenshi really saw this as a punishment..."
 flavor_hkr.10.a.tt: "Every Gensokyan Hakurei Shinto nation, who is not allied with [HVR.GetName], will have increased opinion of us of §G+100§!."
 flavor_hkr.11.t: "The Barrier Team"
 flavor_hkr.11.desc: "Yukari Yakumo and Reimu Hakurei were both the protagonists during the Eternal Night Incident for Gensokyo and helped resolving the Fake Moon Issue. Unlike Marisa and Reimu, Yukari and Reimu are however no friends. However, they respect each other and sometimes even see each other as family (the truthfulness of this is however debatable). As a result of this it was not a big problem for Yukari's people to be integrated into the society of [Root.GetName]."
 flavor_hkr.11.a: "Hopefully they don't cause chaos."
 flavor_hkr.12.t: "Sake gift of the Shrine Maidens"
 flavor_hkr.12.desc: "The clergy of our realm came today to Reimu and gave her the highest quality sake possible in Gensokyo as well as the secret of producing it as a thank-you-gift for resolving the estate conflict."
 flavor_hkr.12.a: "Very nice of them!"
 th_hkr_sake_production_tt: "This gift will most likely attract sake loving oni in the future..."
 flavor_hkr.13.t: "Lifting of a Curse"
 flavor_hkr.13.desc: "Nobody knows who it is nor how it looks like, but the Hakurei God is one of the strongest yet mysterious one of all of Gensokyo and its wrath is feared. Our realm was relatively lucky as the only curse was the Donation Box - and this curse finds finally today its end! The Hakurei God is finally approving Reimu and our realm and lifts the curse of us!"
 flavor_hkr.13.a: "Today is a great day!"
 hkr_appealed_hakurei_god_tt: "The Hakurei God is pleased with our realm!"
 flavor_hkr.14.t: "The Eternal Gift"
 flavor_hkr.14.desc: "The day has come! The many preparations are made, the Curse of the Donation Box has been broken, the Heresy of Gensokyo has been eliminated and our [Root.GovernmentName] enjoys a time of tranquility and peace! Due to this, the gift was not surprising, but still overwhelming: the Hakurei God gave a portion of its power to Reimu Hakurei and granted her immortality! However, the job of a shrine maiden is tiring and Reimu could deserve retirement - but in the end it's her decision."
 flavor_hkr.14.a: "Well, I don't give up this job that easily!"
 flavor_hkr.14.b: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] could use some of my new powers."
 flavor_hkr.14.c: "[Root.GetName] shall remain eternal!"
 flavor_hkr.14.d: "I deserve a peaceful retirement."
 flavor_hkr.15.t: "A Miko and a Samurai"
 flavor_hkr.15.desc: "Long before the Hakurei Reformation and the invention of the Danmaku Combat System, the Hakurei Shrine was originally in the northern part of Gensokyo. During this time a young female samurai called Meira challenged Reimu to an honorable duel. Reimu defeated her quite easily, but she developed certain ... feelings towards Meira and vice versa. However, due to the movement of the shrine and the Hakurei Reformation, the contact between those two broke up. Meira remained in the Old Hakurei Shrine to maintain the traditions while Reimu lives on in the South.\nBut now, that the Old Hakurei Shrine is reclaimed by Reimu, she and Meira had again contact - and with that the emotions might have been revived too..."
 flavor_hkr.15.a: "Well, I do kinda like her..."
 flavor_hkr.15.a.tt: "Reimu Hakurei will be married to Meira when Reimu returns."
 flavor_hkr.15.b: "A Shrine Maiden should remain single."
 flavor_hkr.16.t: "Heresy from Makai"
 flavor_hkr.16.desc: "Rumors come from the North, that the goddess Shinki is reforming the Hakurei Traditions - but unlike how Reimu did it years ago, Shinki is abolishing the praise to all of the Shintoistic deities and made her religion to collect all the faith for herself!"
 flavor_hkr.16.a: "Shinki's making her own religion? Not on my watch!"
 flavor_hkr.16.a.tt: "Get a §YPermanent Claim§! on every province outside of the Makaian states, which follows Shinkism."
 flavor_hkr.17.t: "The Miko and the Witch"
 flavor_hkr.17.desc: "There's no other friendship so well known as the one between Reimu and Marisa. However, even as friends, there are certain things which bring rivalry in their friendship, especially when Incidents become a question. Even though they are friends, they always try to outdo each other and prove themselves as more powerful. While this competition is friendly in nature, it could become one day a problem if one of the two girls starts preying on the other for glory. If [Root.GetName] strikes first, Reimu could finally focus more on solving incidents quicker with Marisa's full support.\nHowever, their friendship has seen way worse and still remained..."
 flavor_hkr.17.a: "I should end this rivalry finally and get Marisa on my side."
 flavor_hkr.17.b: "I will observe Marisa and decide later if we need to end this rivalry."
 flavor_hkr.17.c: "Ah whatever. A little bit of competition never hurts."
 flavor_hkr.20.t: "Youkai Visitor"
 flavor_hkr.20.desc: "Some youkai decided to pay the Hakurei Shrine a visit and dared to go on a fight with [Root.Monarch.GetName]! It didn't take [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] much to defeat these daring youkai though, and in the end, they shared some knowledge about governing with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]."
 flavor_hkr.20.a: "It's always fun to beat them up."
 flavor_hkr.21.t: "Human Visitor"
 flavor_hkr.21.desc: "Some humans decided to visit the Hakurei Shrine and gave [Root.Monarch.GetName] directly a donation!"
 flavor_hkr.21.a: "Thank you very much!"
 flavor_hkr.22.t: "Magician Visitor"
 flavor_hkr.22.desc: "Some magicians tried to steal from the temple! Luckily, they are really bad at lying and after talking into their mind, their guilty feelings brought them back to senses, giving their stolen goods back to [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 flavor_hkr.22.a: "They have yet to learn a lot from Marisa."
 flavor_hkr.23.t: "Old Visitor from the North"
 flavor_hkr.23.desc: "Some old demons from the up north have gotten the idea to visit the Hakurei Shrine. However, the outrage was enormous when they learned that they visited the \"heretical\" Hakurei Shrine and left angrily. However, they forgot on their ways some notes, which are actually quite useful for administration."
 flavor_hkr.23.a: "Well, at least their notes are good mannered."
 flavor_hkr.24.t: "Suika visits the Shrine!"
 flavor_hkr.24.desc: "When she heard that the Shrine got a special sake gift, she just couldn't resist. Suika Ibuki traveled quite a distance through Gensokyo to come back to the Hakurei Shrine just to get a taste for the special sake. However, Reimu still wasn't too happy with Suika's action the last time she was here, so for getting the sake Suika is tasked to repent in heaven and hell and come back a week later."
 flavor_hkr.24.a: "Welp, this should keep her busy for a long time."
 flavor_hkr.25.t: "Part 0: Origin of Gensokyo"
 flavor_hkr.25.desc: "A long time ago youkai and humans lived side by side on the normal world in a symbiotic relationship as Youkai nourish on the human emotions and faith while the humans profit from the youkai by using their powers for humankind. However, over the centuries the humans developed and built kingdoms and civilizations on their own and the balance of this relationship was threatened. To avoid complete extinction, the powerful youkai Yukari Yakumo and other youkai sages created a continent called \"Gensokyo\", which shall be home to the youkai. However, the youkai needed the emotions and faith of humans to survive and as a result of that Yukari convinced many Japanese to make themselves a new life in Gensokyo - most notably our ancestors the Clan of Hakurei.\nAfter enough humans have settled the sages created the Hakurei barrier (in reference to the first clan which settled in Gensokyo), which should seal Gensokyo away from the world forever."
 flavor_hkr.25.a: "Yeah okay, nice origin story for the continent, but what about the Hakurei Clan?"
 flavor_hkr.26.t: "Part 1: Highly Responsive to Prayers"
 flavor_hkr.26.desc: "Originally, our country has been a clan of shrine maidens and guardians from Japan. A role, which we now fulfill in Gensokyo today too. But our current position in Gensokyo wasn't always our home. Before that we lived in the high north of Gensokyo until the early incidents, which were investigated by Reimu Hakurei.\n\nThe first incident was about the sudden destruction of the Hakurei Shrine, the heart of our realm. The culprit was Konngara and her servants from the Old Hell. After several bloody battles and the first encounter with Mima, Reimu managed to defeat Konngara with the power of the unstable Yin-Yang Orbs. Not much is known about this incident later on though and only Konngara and Mima might know more from it."
 flavor_hkr.26.a: "These were weird times."
 flavor_hkr.26.a.tt: "Reimu can §Yrelive§! the memories of her Danmaku Fight against Konngara and face her again in a Danmaku Duel.\nShould she defeat her enemy in her memories she will remember some hidden §Ygold caches§! within the Old Hakurei Shrine and will collect them."
 flavor_hkr.261.t: "Memory of Konngara, the Astral Knight"
 flavor_hkr.261.desc: "A girl in red samurai clothes with a fine katana and a long horn on her forehead - this is the visual memory Reimu has of Konngara, the Astral Knight. Nowadays, Konngara is enjoying a calm life in the remains of Hell's oldest location, the Silent Temple. However, back then she was the culprit of the first destruction of the Old Hakurei Shrine and got confronted by Reimu."
 flavor_hkr.261.a: "I remember she didn't say a single word..."
 flavor_hkr.261.a.tt: "§YThis will trigger the memory of a fight between the Konngara and Reimu!§!"
 flavor_hkr.27.t: "Part 2: Story of Eastern Wonderland"
 flavor_hkr.27.desc: "After the events of the \"High Responsive Prayer\" Incident the shrine enjoyed some time of peace. But this only remained for a short duration as one day the shrine was invaded by hellish monsters of unknown origin. As exterminating these monsters did not stop them from returning, Reimu decided to visit the Old Hell again. During her journey she encountered and defeated the Engineer Rika and the Samurai Meira.\n\nWhen Reimu entered the realm of Reimaden a young witch tried to stop her. It was the young Marisa Kirisame, an apprentice of the ghost Mima! At first these two saw each other as enemies and could not stand each other. However, after Marisa's and Mima's unavoidable defeat, Marisa decided to leave Reimaden to discover the wonders of Gensokyo on her own..."
 flavor_hkr.27.a: "Also, her hair returned back to blonde too."
 flavor_hkr.27.a.tt: "Reimu can §Yrelive§! the memories of her Danmaku Fight against Mima and face her again in a Danmaku Duel.\nShould she defeat her enemy in her memories she will remember some hidden §Ygold caches§! within the Old Hakurei Shrine and will collect them."
 flavor_hkr.271.t: "Memory of Mima, the Evil Spirit"
 flavor_hkr.271.desc: "No ghost is as infamous as Mima is within Gensokyo. There have been rumors that she will come back and that her return will mean the end of Gensokyo. Reimu remembers the chaos that Mima has caused back in the days with her summoning of hellish creatures within the Hakurei Shrine - and Reimu had enough of that. When she confronted Mima in Reimaden it came to an epic battle between these two."
 flavor_hkr.271.a: "Good griefs... I don't want to think back to her Twilight Spark..."
 flavor_hkr.271.a.tt: "§YThis will trigger the memory of a fight between the Mima and Reimu!§!"
 flavor_hkr.28.t: "Part 3: Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream"
 flavor_hkr.28.desc: "Following the \"Eastern Wonderland Stories\" Incident the shrine maiden found one day curious ruins not far from the Hakurei Shrine. As rumors of wish fulfilling being have reached the rest of Gensokyan many people traveled to the Fantasy Ruins to harness the power for themselves. But the ruins were quite small and only one person could get a wish. Naturally, a big battle royal happened and everyone fought against everybody. One of those persons was Marisa again and while these two were enemies on battle they started to have sympathy to each other."
 flavor_hkr.28.a: "Didn't Ellen do some kind of dance after she has dominated two other opponents?"
 flavor_hkr.28.a.tt: "Reimu can §Yrelive§! the memories of her Danmaku Fight against Yumemi and face her again in a Danmaku Duel.\nShould she defeat her enemy in her memories she will remember some hidden §Ygold caches§! within the Old Hakurei Shrine and will collect them."
 flavor_hkr.281.t: "Memory of Professor Yumemi Okazaki"
 flavor_hkr.281.desc: "Not much is known about the ones, who call themselves \"Time Traveler\" other than that they do their name justice. Although they are a mystery for the usual Gensokyan, Reimu can remember when Yumemi Okazaki, the leader of the Time Travelers, crashed into the Back Mountain. In order to hide themselves, they disguised their \"ship\" as ruins. However, Yumemi's assistant, Chiyuri, had to spread a rumor of a genie in the Fantasy Ruins, which eventually lead to Reimu facing off Yumemi."
 flavor_hkr.281.a: "Ah yes. I won my own personal maid on this day."

 flavor_hkr.29.desc: "The Northern Lands were like cursed as our realm had to go through three incidents in quick succession and the fourth did not let wait for it. When Reimu tried to finally relax the Hakurei Shrine got invaded by dozens and dozens of youkai. She and her former enemy and now good friend Marisa were more than annoyed by the sheer influx of new youkai. They went out to seal the source of these new youkai, which led them eventually to Mugenkan, the mansion of Yuuka Kazami. She revealed that she scared all the youkai off from her realm to finally enjoy more peace."

 flavor_hkr.291.desc: "Plaid rugs. Plaid carpet. And plaid clothes. While Yuuka Kazami is known to be one of the most powerful youkai, her taste for fashion was always outlandish to Reimu. Her concerns however started when she had to face Yuuka in the danmaku duel..."

 flavor_hkr.30.t: "Part 5: Mystic Square"
 flavor_hkr.30.desc: "Only 12 hours later after the \"Lotus Land Story\" Incident the shrine was yet again invaded, this time by demons from the neighboring realm Makai. Reimu Hakurei was exhausted, but she could not let these demons stay in Gensokyo. So the young shrine maiden traveled to Makai, followed by Marisa, Mima and Yuuka. On her journey she saw how powerful demons suppressed youkai and how danmaku are used against disobedient fairies. After many fights, which almost ended lethally for Reimu, she managed to confront Shinki in Pandemonium and defeated her barely..."

 flavor_hkr.301.desc: "The Goddess of Creation, the Mistress of Makai and Mother of Alice Margatroid. There might be more titles, but Shinki always uses these three. Nobody in Gensokyo was as difficult and dangerous to defeat for Reimu than Shinki - especially since there was no security during a Danmaku Duel back then. The fight against Shinki was one to life and death for herself. One she luckily won."
 flavor_hkr.301.a: "Fortunately, Shinki is a nowadays a lot calmer."

 flavor_hkr.31.desc: "Reimu returned after her final battle against Shinki to the Old Hakurei Shrine - or that what was remaining of it. Our old realm, her home, has been completely destroyed. All what is left are the foundations of the shrine and the donation box. After minutes which felt like hours of grief, the silence has been broken by the arrival of a person. She introduced herself to Reimu as Yukari Yakumo and asked her what has happened to her and the shrine, which should protect the Hakurei Barrier. After hearing the sobbing Yukari has made an offer: Yukari and the other youkai sages will think a system out, which will give even the powerless youkai and humans a chance to fight back. This system will be then integrated in the shintoistic beliefs and traditions. In return, Reimu will protect this new religious direction and enforce it within Gensokyo.\n\nReimu didn't take a second to accept this offer and left the ruins of the Hakurei Shrine behind her. She led the survivors of our people to the South of Gensokyo to rebuild the Clan and the Shrine there."
 flavor_hkr.31.a: "What happens next?"
 flavor_hkr.32.t: "Epilogue"
 flavor_hkr.32.desc: "In the mean time a new power has entered Gensokyo's stage: Scarlet Realm, led by the vampire Remilia Scarlet. Remilia brought spells and powers from the far west, which were exceeding anything before in raw spell power. After seeing Remilia's strength and fearing that Remilia would conquer Gensokyo single handily, Yukari ordered her to stick to the so called \"Spell Card System\".\n\nThe Spell Cards are an experimental dueling system, which should put beauty and grace to the focus instead of firepower. It fulfills the purpose of giving even the weakest human and youkai a legitimate fighting chance against somebody like Remilia. And while there is no pressure to stick to the system, it has become very quickly a standard to honor it nonetheless. It even goes so far so that this Spell Card System became very quickly a fundamental part of the new Hakurei Shintoism."
 flavor_hkr.32.a: "Go on."
 flavor_hkr.33.t: "Epilogue"
 flavor_hkr.33.desc: "Reimu then trained several new shrine maidens in the teachings of youkai extermination, danmaku battles and the new Spell Card System. She managed to convert many people - be it youkai or humans - to Hakurei Shintoism, teaching them to stick to the Spell Card rules. It didn't take long until Hakurei Shintoism has been spreading from the Hell in Higan all the way to the Perfect Cut Coast.\n\nMeanwhile, Meira has returned to the Old Hakurei Shrine to challenge Reimu again, but all she found were ruins. After hearing what has happened to Reimu and the shrine she decided to rebuild and maintain it in hope of Reimu's return. Eventually, rumors of a new \"Hakurei Shintoism\" have reached Meira and when she noticed, how caretaking the Spell Card System is, she chose to call all together, who want to stay to the true ways of Shintoism and fighting. This movement later became the \"Hakurei Tradition\"."

 flavor_hkr.34.t: "Epilogue"
 flavor_hkr.34.desc: "While all that was happening, Marisa Kirisame decided to move away too. During her journey in Makai she found a new colleague: Alice Margatroid. Despite their differences and conflicts they became good friends. They turned their back to North Gensokyo when they heard about Reimu and her implementing the Spell Card System in Gensokyo and decided to settle in the Forest of Magic.\n\nMeanwhile, Mima tried to become a god on her own, but got bored eventually and returned to Reimaden. It's unclear what she might plan...\nYuuka tried to become the new goddess of Makai. However, she got bored of this idea and the fight with Shinki wasn't worth it for her. So she returned to Mugenkan and started creating her own sunflower field.\nShinki made sure that the demons would remain in Makai. After she said goodbye to her daughter, she let Alice leave Makai to do her own adventures.\nKonngara still slumbers in the Fallen Temple while Rika met Nitori and Yumemi and decided to create an engineers guild.\n\nOnly time will tell what the future will hold for North Gensokyo..."

However, when she saw her old friends from an ancient era, she was more than happy to receive them.\nMarisa, Alice and Ellen talked about all the events, which have occurred since their the last time they have seen each other. Ellen yearned to be back with the other magicians. She suggested to open a second shop in the Forest of Magic, but this will need some investment before."

 flavor_scr.1.desc: "Most of the time the former rulers Satori and Remilia tolerated each other's presence, but neither of them tried for a better relation between their realms - unlike their little sisters. Flandre and Koishi were always good friends, and now, after their sisters left their thrones, their realms became great allies too."
 flavor_scr.1.a: "Let's hope for a never ending friendship."
 flavor_scr.2.t: "Ludwig van Beethoven"
 flavor_scr.2.desc: "In Austria, a musician becomes famous and beloved for his musical masterpieces. Ludwig van Beethoven was a universal genius widely regarded as the greatest composer who ever lived. He dominated a period of musical history like no other. Rooted in the Classical traditions of Haydn and Mozart, his art reaches out to encompass the new spirit of humanism expressed in the works of Goethe and Schiller, his elder contemporaries in the world of literature, and above all in the ideals of the French Revolution with its passionate concern for the freedom and dignity of the individual. His works made a great impact on the music world and even our [Root.Monarch.GetName] enjoys his compositions - especially Sonata Pathétique, which could be a magnificent theme for our $MONARCHTITLE$."
 flavor_scr.2.a: "Hire this man! I want him to compose a theme for me."

But while this place has been forgotten, the Flemish people of Flanders still remember the Scarlets very well. Flandre is unknowingly visiting not only the origin of her name, but also her and her sister's birthplace - and the local people never forgot the chaos the Scarlet Sisters did in their early years. But at the same time, the Flemish are happy to see a familiar face who could liberate them from the occupation of the other great powers like France, Spain and Austria - and Flandre shall be their queen..."

 flavor_scr.6.desc.a: "With our military superiority and the finesse of [Root.Monarch.GetName], we managed to take control over the throne of [CRD.GetName], the rulers of Former Hell. However, despite our clear superiority, Satori and Koishi Komeiji don't recognize the might of our beloved [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. And as such all of our demands for support only meet on deaf ears. While Remilia could manipulate fate and force them to serve, it would just cause a long term problem with the residents of Former Hell.\nNo, to gain the support of the [CRD.GetAdjective] they need a proof that we treat the Komeijis with the highest respect and try our best to appease them."
 flavor_scr.6.desc.b: "With the fall of [CRD.GetName], the invasion into Former Hell was an easy task. However, the residents of that region have proven to be quite resistant towards [Root.GetAdjective] authority. While the Komeijis might be technically their leaders anymore, the inhabitants of Former Hell still hear the word of hers more than ours. If we want to get control over the situation we need to convince them of ourselves. This also means we need to appease the two great satoris, who are still lurking in the Former Hell's shadows."

However, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has proven her, that our realm has best of intentions for the people of Former Hell and for her family. At first the mind reader didn't want to believe it, but our efforts to increase the security of Chireiden, to support Koishi in her quest and to help the residents of Former Hell have left a good impression of us.\nAfter several hours of talk, the Komeijis have declared ready to step down of the throne of Former Hell and allow [Root.Monarch.GetName] to get in charge!"
 flavor_scr.9.desc.b: "The residents of Former Hell are distrustful creatures and our conquest of their home didn't increase their opinion of us at all.

 flavor_scr.11.desc: "Unlike Remilia and Satori, the relationship between Flandre and Koishi has always been on friendly terms - even if it is a very unknown friendship. After all, only a handful people can even recognize Koishi so it is no surprise that she always managed to bypass the guard of the Scarlet Devil Mansion and visit her good friend Flandre.\nBefore the conquest of Chireiden, Flandre had plenty of time to spend with Koishi, but now she is in a position, where so much weight is on her shoulders and as such the time to play with Koishi has been significantly rarer, which saddens Koishi. However, one day, Koishi stormed into the throne room and had the brilliant idea of how to get more play time together! And so, Koishi proposed to Flandre in public, but only the two of them know what's going on while everyone else notice nothing ..."

However, she has requested to visit her home land again should we decide to travel to Chinese land..."

 flavor_scr.18.t: "Patchouli joins the Court"
 flavor_scr.18.desc: "Patchouli is a very ... relaxed person. She avoids sport, stays away from sunlight much more than any vampire would and has her nose only in books. It was quite the surprise for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to see her in the court room out of the sudden of course as Patchouli usually avoided politics too. But because of our mistress' help in her many experiments (and maybe because of one comment too many about her body weight), she decided to join [Root.Monarch.GetName] in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] political business and support our realm with her advises."

With 111 meters in height and over 2,938 tons, this behemoth of a missile has pierced the sky and reached the moon within under a week. Of course for Remilia this is really slow, but for the several hundreds of our vampiric colonists, this was a quick time.\nWhen the rocket landed on the moon, it immediately got a visit from curious moon rabbits. At first they appeared to be friendly, but when a weird noise appeared, the rabbits immediately opened fire. Fortunately our colonists are expert fighters and slaughtered these treacherous rabbits and enacted a counter attack, which disabled the lunar defenses.\nWe came to the moon as visitors, but got treated as invaders. There weren't many reasons for us to conquer the moon, but their hostility showed us that they are a threat to our realm and all life of Earth!"

Unlike our good [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], our soldiers are reveling in the heat of the battle and enjoy the combat even if they fall on the battlefield. While [Root.Monarch.GetName] does not share their enthusiasm, their blood lust, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] advisors have made a plan to restructure the government to support their morale with the charisma of our beloved [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\nThey also point out that with the establishment of a 'Scarlet Monarchy', our neighbors will have a better idea who they are dealing with and would even be ready to trust us."

 flavor_scr.25.tt: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] will make an offer of §R2000§! Ducats to the owner of this island.\nIf we do not view as enemies and the opinion is not below 0, the owner will most likely accept the offer."

 flavor_scr.26.desc: "A young girl in a formal attire arrived at our court and offered [Root.Monarch.GetName] 2000 Ducats in exchange for an island in our possession. She claims she is here in the name of her mistress, a batgirl, who is referred as the \"Scarlet Devil\"..."
 flavor_scr.26.a: "Devil or not, Ducats are always welcomed!"
 flavor_scr.26.b: "We do not make deals with the devil!"

 flavor_scr.29.t: "Remilia's Ambitions"
 flavor_scr.29.desc: "With the return to Europe, our good mistress Remilia announced a long list of ambitions and claims her bloodline has created over centuries. It was a 30 meter long parchment, with various descriptions of claims: it starts with the title of Flanders ownership and ends with the right of forming a crusade in Anatolia!"
 flavor_scr.29.a: "And a lot more ambitions are on their way!"
 flavor_scr.30.t: "The missing Mansion"
 flavor_scr.30.desc: "After hours of travel, Remilia and Sakuya, arrived at the spot, where the origin of Sakuya is supposed to be, deep in the dark woods of Lancashire. But there was nothing. Just trees and wild life. Remilia looks confused at the sight. Sakuya notes to have a strange feeling of oddity ... as if they are too soon at this place. The maiden explains that the mansion; her place of origin might appear in a later century."
 flavor_scr.30.a: "Hmpf... whatever you say, Sakuya."
 flavor_scr.30.a.tt: "Remilia and Sakuya will return to this place after Queen Anne style architecture has been discovered in England."
 flavor_scr.31.t: "The Mansion of Liverpool"
 flavor_scr.31.desc: "Remilia and Sakuya travelled to the little English town called \"Liverpool\". In order to avoid public attention, Remilia hid her wings in her attire.\nUpon their arrival, they got greeted by a polite butler. He seemed to recognize Sakuya... but at the same time he couldn't tell why.\nThe two girls entered the mansion and met with a noble merchant, who at first was worried because of the invited guests, but soon started to get along quite well with Remilia. It appears the man is one of the many aspiring aristocrats of the British Islands and has yet to learn a lot about being a gentleman. He too had an odd feeling of familiarity upon seeing Sakuya face, but just like the butler, he couldn't tell why.\nAfter a lengthy afternoon of chatting and enjoying tea, the vampire and her maiden came to no conclusion whatsoever and left the nobleman with a hearty farewell. In the carriage, Sakuya noted that they were too early. But she was happy to see the ancestors of her better half of her family..."

 flavor_scr.33.t: "End of the Papacy"
 flavor_scr.33.desc: "A long time ago, humans lived in harmony with western 'youkai', fairies and other supernatural creatures. This all changed when Christianity spread through Europe though and quickly after that, every supernatural being - be it rightfully or not - has been hunted down to extinction. All in the name of the Christian beliefs and the Pope! But now the tables have turned and the Pope is at our mercy! As we all know, mercy is the mark of a great woman."

 flavor_scr.34.desc: "Most of the time the former rulers Satori and Remilia tolerated each other's presence, but neither of them tried for a better relation between their realms - unlike their little sisters. Flandre and Koishi were always good friends, and now, after their sisters left their thrones, their realms became great allies too."
 flavor_scr.34.a: "Let's hope for a never ending friendship."

 flavor_flr.1.desc: "Mistress Remilia's sister, Flandre has been living in a basement for many long years. Over time, she became nostalgic for the Outworld, especially for the old European land where she spent her childhood, and wanted to rule land and army like her sister. Of course, her sister didn't think to listen to this request.\nOne day, a purple beauty suddenly appeared in a tightly locked basement. She said she would take Flandre to her homeland in Europe, and give her a chance to rule the small country there if she wanted to. How should she respond to this welcome but sudden suggestion? The choice is up to 'you'..."

 flavor_flr.2.t: "The Mistress Leading the Army"
 flavor_flr.2.desc: "Our army and people rose up to fight against the oppressors, but because of the lack of military experience, there is no commander worthy of command. mistress Flandre saw this situation and sent a mana-made clone to lead our army.

 flavor_flr.2.a: "Glory to Mistress!"
 flavor_flr.2.a.tt: "Flandre's Clone §Y(4/5/4/2)§! will lead the army"
 flavor_flr.3.t: "A Legitimate Female Candidate"
 flavor_flr.3.desc: "Lex Salica was created to prevent women from inheriting the throne in Francia. But the big premise of this law is that women cannot lead the army! Our mistress has shown her fighting with the army herself(though most of them don't know it's a Clone), which has neutralized the most important basis of this law! Thanks to our presence in the empire and the help of electors who rely on her, our mistress has qualified herself to run for the Emperor's election!"
 flavor_flr.3.a: "Glory to Mistress!"
 flavor_flr.31.t: "On the debris of the Empire"
 flavor_flr.31.desc: "The group of nations that was even shameful to refer to as an empire, which adhered to the old ways and laws, collapsed before our power. German princes and their people are confused about what to do in the face of the rapidly changing situation. The answer given to them is only one and that is to swear allegiance to the great mistress who will build a new empire on the debris of the Old empire!"
 flavor_flr.31.a: "The new empire rises!"
 flavor_flr.5.t: "Transfer Electorate?"
 flavor_flr.5.desc: "We may be able to make use of Brandenburg's military as well as their Electorate status. We can ask the Emperor to hand over their Electorate post to us. Of course, it's going to cost enough..."
 flavor_flr.5.a: "It's worth a try."
 flavor_flr.5.b: "Is that really necessary?"
 flavor_flr.51.t: "Transfer the Brandenburg Electorate to Flandre?"
 flavor_flr.51.desc: "A letter from Flandre, who took control of Brandenburg, has sent us. They are demanding that Brandenburg hand over Electorate's right to them! It's unprecedented, but it's inevitable that they'll have eyes on the gifts they brought with them..."
 flavor_flr.51.a: "Long live the Elector of [From.GetUsableName]!"
 flavor_flr.51.a2: "Let it be done."
 flavor_flr.51.b: "The Electorate shall remain with the Brandenburg."

 flavor_flr.6.t: "A letter from Europe"
 flavor_flr.6.desc: "From far beyond the sea, a letter from your sister arrived. She has now become a ruler who commands Europe, not an old basement, and has sent a proposal to unite you and her country for common prosperity. Of course under her rule. How would you like to answer?"
 flavor_flr.6.a: "I don't want to admit it, but I think she's better than I am."
 flavor_flr.6.b: "If she wants the crown, tell her to take it directly from my head!"
 flavor_flr.61.t: "A wise choice"
 flavor_flr.61.desc: "Your sister wisely accepted your offer. Now not only Europe but also Gensokyo will receive your fair rule, my Kaiserin!"
 flavor_flr.61.a: "That's what I wanted!"
 flavor_flr.62.t: "The Board is broken"
 flavor_flr.62.desc: "foolishly, your sister rejected your offer! If she refuses to make a wise decision on the pretext of pride until the end, you will have no choice but to teach her yourself, my Kaiserin!"
 flavor_flr.62.a: "I'll show you I'm not who I used to be, Remilia!"
 flavor_flr.7.t: "An unsendable letter"
 flavor_flr.7.desc: "Poor thing, the realm your sister ruled has already disappeared. The Komeiji family, our long-time rival, has taken over your other home! Now that they have taken the land of your family, it is now your turn to take it again, my Kaiserin!"
 flavor_flr.7.a: "I'll make them regret that!"
 flavor_flr.8.t: "The Kaiserin sparks a Fashion Craze"
 flavor_flr.8.desc: "As a candidate for the Holy Roman crown, Countess Flandre Scarlet boasted near-universal support among the prince-electors. This popularity manifested in their votes - and now, in their spending habits. Across the Empire nobles minor and powerful have taken to emulating the new Empress' appearance, adopting her bright blood-colored dresses and comfortable choices in hattery and seeking out cut gems imitative of her distinct multicolored wings. Merchants in Europe have increased their imports of dyes, jewels, and fine cloth in response, hoping to capitalize on the German fashion craze as long as it lasts; flattery may be feigned, but gold is very, very real."
 flavor_flr.8.a: "Nicht die Schönheit entscheidet wen wir lieben..."
 flavor_flr.8.b: "...sondern die Liebe entscheidet wen wir schön finden."
 flavor_flr.9.t: "Return to the Gensokyan faith?"
 flavor_flr.9.desc: "Once our realm and our mistress were part of the Scarlet Realm, a nation ruled by Remilia Scarlet in Gensokyo. As such she and her people followed the Hakurei Shintoistic Ways. However, when Flandre got the opportunity to start her own path to glory in Europe she had to change her official religion to Catholic.\nBut now that we have established a considerable power base in Europe as well contact with Gensokyo yet again, Reimu Hakurei is making us an offer to return to the Gensokyan faith. How shall our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] react?"
 flavor_flr.9.a: "The belief of our realm was always Gensokyan at heart. It is time to return to it."
 flavor_flr.9.b: "Europe is our home - and with that its beliefs are now ours."
 flavor_flr.10.t: "Results of the Family Logbook"
 flavor_flr.10.desc: "With Flandre's friends in London she managed to get the Family Logbook of all noble families on the British Isles. After several hours of reading and researching Flan only found out that her family was once part of the British Isles, but moved to the Low Countries later - a dead end for Flandre's researches.\nHowever, something else got her attention too: in the book there were notes about a rich family, which adopted a young boy. Years later the boy killed the father and transformed himself into a vampire and only after a final battle against his step brother, he got defeated. It is said that this vampire had a girl daughter..."
 flavor_flr.10.a: "All I was looking for was the origin of my family. Instead, I found Sakuya's bloodline..."
 flavor_flr.11.t: "The mysterious Item"
 flavor_flr.11.desc: "It has the form of a face with two little fangs and as soon it touches blood it makes a sudden movement, releasing spikes. One of Flandre's advisor tried the effects of the mask out on themselves and turned into an undead vampire! Such evil creature got immediately destroyed by our good [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], but in all this chaos the mask vanished again and was never seen again..."
 flavor_flr.11.a: "I hope this mask won't cause more harm..."
 flavor_flr.12.t: "Flandre's Decision of Faith"
 flavor_flr.12.desc: "Europe has fallen in an age of reformation and religious chaos. Unlike our previous home, Gensokyo, the people here are more aggressive towards heresies and wars about religions have become a common sight here. It is clear that our beloved mistress must make a choice where she stands within this time of conflicts of faiths."
 flavor_flr.12.a: "We remain loyal to the Man with the funny hat!"
 flavor_flr.12.a.tt: "Take the §YCatholic Path§!!"
 flavor_flr.12.b: "I will not kneel before a man in a dress!"
 flavor_flr.12.b.tt: "Take the §YReformation Path§!!"
 flavor_flr.12.c: "My sister was right. Shintoism is a better religion."
 flavor_flr.12.c.tt: "Take the §YGensokyan Path§!!"
 flavor_flr.12.d: "Why do people fight each other for a non-existent playmate?"
 flavor_flr.12.d.tt: "Take the §YTolerant Path§!!"
 flavor_flr.13.t: "A Letter of the Electors"
 flavor_flr.13.desc: "The electors of the Holy Roman Empire were gathered by Flandre Scarlet for one purpose: the demand of dropping the [Root.Religion.GetName] Faith as the state religion of the Empire and signing a Treaty of religious equality. If we decide to do this we will get the support of the heretics, but this at the cost of all the rewards from our well earned victory..."
 flavor_flr.13.a: "Concede to the demands."
 flavor_flr.13.b: "Ignore them."
 flavor_flr.14.t: "Contract of Scarlet Peace"
 flavor_flr.14.desc: "The Religious League War was one huge, bloody mess and many people died just for their cross can hang in the throne room of the Holy Roman Empire. While the blood will not go to waste and will be great drinks for Flandre, the future shall not be like this again. For this reason, the fair Empress, has decided to create a contract, which will ensure that never again will a religious war happen in Europe. All what is missing is her signature..."
 flavor_flr.14.a: "*Signs cheerfully the Contract*"
 flavor_flr.14.b: "On a second thought ..."
 flavor_flr.15.t: "The Devil of Rhine"
 flavor_flr.15.desc: "Originally a salary man of the future, now a soldier with high magical skills rivaling even our brightest magicians: Tanya von Degurechaff is a powerful human with magical abilities. Her life started humbly as an orphan, but when [Root.Mil_Advisor.GetName] tested the children of the orphanage for their magical capabilities Tanya revealed her hidden potential.\nAt just nine years of age, Tanya entered the [Root.GetName]'s Mage troops and was promoted to Second Lieutenant. Later, she made decisive victories with her very own mage battalion and got later promoted to Major. Her talents, strategies, efficiency, and ruthlessness make her a useful asset for the [Root.GovernmentName] and a threat on the battlefield. Due to her brutality against the enemies of the realm she earned the nickname \"the Devil of Rhine\"."
 flavor_flr.15.a: "She is neither human nor vampire! She is the Devil!"
 ###EVENTS FOR MRY###
 flavor_mry.1.t: "Religious Authority of Hell"
 flavor_mry.1.desc: "Higan, also known as Hell, is the seat of the most powerful goddess Hecatia Lapislazuli as well as the home of mighty yamas - the judges of Gensokyo. Many humans think that Hakurei Clan, Senkai, Myouren Temple and whatnot are the hubs of religious authority in Gensokyo, but this is not true. As in the end they all have to answer in front of the Yamaxanadu, who is currently a follower of the Hakurei Faith.\nFortunately, our goddess Suwako has good contact with Eiki and could convince her to switch the official religion to ours."
 flavor_mry.1.a: "Sure. Let's give her a try."
 flavor_mry.1.b: "It's not worth it."
 flavor_mry.2.t: "Suwako visits the Yama"
 flavor_mry.2.desc: "While the [From.GetName] is our ally, their religious ambitions are quite ... high. Their goal is to enlighten all of Gensokyo to the right path of Shintoism. In the end, none of the religions are really important if a soul lands in Higan for their judgment.\nHowever, Goddess Suwako Moriya visited us personally and empathized on the political importance of our decision to convert to her religion."
 flavor_mry.2.a: "We will convert for her sake."
 flavor_mry.2.b: "The Judge of Gensokyo stands over political intrigues."

 flavor_mry.104.t: "Independence!"
 flavor_mry.104.desc: "[From.GetName] lost its way and changed the nature of their realm severely. They are no longer a desirable religious guidance for us! From now on we have to find our own path in this world!"
 flavor_mry.104.a: "So be it."
 ###EVENTS FOR MKI###
 flavor_mki.1.t: "Reunion with Alice"
 flavor_mki.1.desc: "Our mistress couldn't hold her joy. Dear Alice, one of her beloved children who left Makai years ago was finally found in the Forest of Magic, alongside Marisa. But for some reason both of them couldn't remember the past events as if that particular part of their memory was erased by someone. Every time Alice tried to delve deep into her mind thinking about the person in front of her, it gave the magician a painful headache. It seems reasoning under these circumstances would be quite hard."
 flavor_mki.1.a: "I should still try to talk things out and make Alice remember her past."
 flavor_mki.1.a.tt: "§YThis will trigger a \"Diplomatic Danmaku Fight\" between [Root.Monarch.GetName] and Alice!§!\nBecause you know Alice quite well you gain §G[Root.th_additional_diplomatic_boni.GetValue]§! §YDanmaku Power§! for this argument!"
 flavor_mki.1.b: "Negotiations just don't work. We have to bring her to Makai and show everything."
 flavor_mki.1.b.tt: "This will immediately trigger a war between Forest of Magic and us - and we will be seen as the aggressor!"
 flavor_mki.1.c: "I don't think she'll listen to me yet. I'll give her some time for now."
 flavor_mki.1.c.tt: "This choice will give you one more chance to persuade Alice when you want to."
 flavor_mki.2.t: "Conclusion of the clash with Alice"
 flavor_mki.2.desc: "In the end, Alice remembered everything from the past - living in Makai, meeting with Reimu and Marisa for the first time, Devil's world and finally opening the door of a picture book. She remembered using for the first and last time that dreadful Grimoire which provoked the future chain of events. Luckily, after we are done with the aftermath of this magic, Shinki and Alice can peacefully reunite."
 flavor_mki.2.a: "Let's live happily together from now on."
 flavor_mki.3.t: "Conclusion of the clash with Alice"
 flavor_mki.3.desc: "Unfortunately, Shinki couldn't reach Alice's mind. No matter how hard she tried, there was an invisible wall blocking the past recollections of the magician girl and even the Devil God was helpless against it. Perhaps, Alice is not ready and time has yet to come..."
 flavor_mki.3.a: "I shall wait. Always."
 flavor_mki.102.t: "Meeting with Alice"

 flavor_mki.5.a: "Praise Shinki!"
 flavor_mki.5.b: "I wonder what those two are up to...."
 flavor_mki.6.t: "Reunion of mother and daughter"
 flavor_mki.6.desc: "Shinki went again to the forest of magic to persuade Alice. Alice still doesn't seem to remember what happened in the past, but seems to be listening for now to her self-proclaimed "mother" who came alone without an army. Maybe Shinki could bring back Alice's old memories?"
 flavor_mki.6.a: "Beloved daughter, have you forgotten me already?"
 ###EVENTS FOR GNU###
 flavor_gnu.1.t: "Youkai Forest"
 flavor_gnu.1.desc: "As our troops approached Youkai Forest, Mugetsu's guards started looking all around for any trace of the Yorigami sisters. Unfortunately after a few days our efforts proved to be fruitless - those two managed to sneak out of our sight. According to the rumors though, they might be hiding in a second place."
 flavor_gnu.1.a: "We shall continue looking for them."
 flavor_gnu.2.t: "Hakurei Shrine"
 flavor_gnu.2.desc: "After taking over the Hakurei Shrine Gengetsu's guards started thoroughly searching for the poverty god, Shion Yorigami.

 flavor_gnu.2.a: "We shall continue looking for them."
 flavor_gnu.3.t: "Meeting the vicious sisters"
 flavor_gnu.3.desc: "Finally, as Mugetsu and Gengetsu took over both Youkai Forest and Hakurei Shrine, we managed to catch the Yorigami sisters. As our mistresses cornered them, Dream sisters finally managed to prove once again their title as vicious sisters!"
 flavor_gnu.3.a: "Finally we can rightfully claim our title!"
 flavor_gnu.4.t: "The [5001.GetName] Question"
 flavor_gnu.4.desc: "With our new allies and armies, [Root.GetName] is a new position, where it could have a chance against the dreaded youkai Yuuka. Declaring war on [SFF.GetName] would be suicide though. Fortunately, we have valid and reasonable claims on the Lotus Road as it indeed used to be part of our realm. [Root.Monarch.GetName] prepared an ultimatum for Yuuka. If she refuses to cede the province then all of Gensokyo will see this as an act of [SFF.GetAdjective] aggression against [Root.GetName]."
 flavor_gnu.4.a: "[5001.GetName] is ours! Yuuka should cede it to us immediately!"
 flavor_gnu.4.a.tt: "We will demand §Y[5001.GetName]§! from §Y[SFF.GetName]§!. This will most likely result into a §RWar§! against §Y[SFF.GetName]§!."
 flavor_gnu.4.b: "It's not worth the risk."
 flavor_gnu.5.t: "[From.GetName] demands [5001.GetName]!"
 flavor_gnu.5.desc: "The insolent creatures of [From.GetName] demand [5001.GetName] for themselves. They claim that they had control over this province way before we have and think their petty alliances and armies would give them the right to put us before this ultimatum!"
 flavor_gnu.5.a: "I make sure they will suffer for this insult!"
 flavor_gnu.5.b: "*Sigh* Fine, they can have it."
 flavor_gnu.5.c: "What's that? I'm sorry, but these demons are not worth my time."
 flavor_gnu.6.t: "The Devils' Feet at Heaven's Doors"
 flavor_gnu.6.desc: "Celestials and devils are natural enemies. It is in the nature of the two species. Due to the enormous distance between the Dream World and Heaven and Hakurei Barrier, there was no reason for both species to interact though - until recently. Due to the genius tactical moves of [Root.Monarch.GetName], [Root.GetName] is in control over this pesky heaven and its inhabitants. Many of us wish to exploit the celestials and use them as labor slaves, but doing so will naturally upset the occupied celestials..."
 flavor_gnu.6.a: "Maybe... but if they complain then you didn't hit them hard enough."
 flavor_gnu.6.b: "We don't need to exploit them atop of conquering them."
 flavor_gnu.7.t: "Destruction of [LCU.GetName]"
 flavor_gnu.7.desc: "The Lunarians: terrifying creatures, who isolate themselves from the \"filth\" we call Earth. They have a hatred for all what they deem as \"impure\" and have no hesitation to enslave worthless creatures like rabbits.\nThey got spirit, that is for sure. But they lacked vision and as such they too fell victim to the armies of [Root.GetName]. Now their city is in our hands and our soldiers; our people demand one thing: a fire, which brings fear to all Lunarians and Gensokyans alike!"
 flavor_gnu.7.a: "BURN BABY! BURN!!"

 th_mahou.15.desc: "As we came back to Gensokyo, our mistresses have met a forgetful witch Ellen. She turned our to be a very nice person and was really happy to give our country a help.

To some extent.\nNevertheless Byakuren is willing to either help administering our realm, or bolster physical capabilities of our soldiers."

 flavor_mkn.1.desc.a: "As our realm is expanding and growing more and more powerful, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] starts drawing [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] attention to Gensokyo. Though [Root.Monarch.GetName] is feeling reluctant, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] still has sworn loyalty to Makai. The Goddess Shinki seems to be more than happy to take over our realm, but this time she will hold the throne of [Root.GetName] first, then the throne of Makai.\nWhile it might be a good option for [Root.GetName] in the long run, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will be completely removed from the throne and the succession..."
 flavor_mkn.1.desc.b: "While our realm is expanding in the Outworld, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] did not forget our home of origins - Gensokyo. [Root.Monarch.GetName] was shocked however when [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] returned to Gensokyo: the once mighty goddess Shinki has become a petty subject!"
 flavor_mkn.1.a: "Shinki has always been our ruler. It is time to give her the throne."
 flavor_mkn.1.b: "Unacceptable! It is me, who shall rule over both realms!"
 flavor_mkn.1.c: "Then we shall remain independent from Makai."
 flavor_mkn.1.d: "Shinki is OUR goddess. If anything, she shall be OUR subject!"

 flavor_mkn.2.t: "Makai has fallen!"
 flavor_mkn.2.desc: "Bad news! Some foreign powers managed to conquer the land of Makai and now mistress Shinki flees to our realm. She asks us to give her a refuge. We can either formally transfer the rulership over New World of Ice and Snow to Shinki and reclaim the heartland of Makai in her name, or we can just provide her housing in exchange for some presents."
 flavor_mkn.2.a: "It is a good idea to transfer the crown to Shinki."

 ###EVENTS FOR CRD###
 flavor_crd.1.t: "Question of Religious Direction"
 flavor_crd.1.desc: "Religion was never a great concern for Satori nor her subjects, but in recent times religious tension has built up in Gensokyo - and in our realm! While most of our people follow Hakurei's Shintoism ways, a few major places have been converted to Moriya's religion. Additionally the influence of Kanako over Reiuji is unsettlingly high and even Koishi seeks the Moriya Shrine more and more often. How should our realm react to these changes?"
 flavor_crd.1.a: "Call this annoying shrine maiden. Tell her she has a job to do here."
 flavor_crd.1.b: "Why should I care which religion my subjects follow?"
 flavor_crd.1.c: "This Hakurei maiden annoyed me anyway, so why do we not just convert to Moriya?"
 flavor_crd.2.t: "Rin Kaenbyou in Egypt"
 flavor_crd.2.desc: "The sun burns down on the hot sand. The air is incredibly dry and the wasteland wherever the eye reaches. For the most people, everything of Egypt, which is not the Nil, is hell. For Rin, it is like a ski vacation though.\nUnder the eternal sand lies a civilization, which was rich in culture and had a whole pantheon of important deities - the deity of Rin's interest, Bastet, especially. Due to long distance between [Root.GetName] and Egypt, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided (on behalf of Rin) to establish an own base in these deserts."
 flavor_crd.2.a: "We will of course support her as good as we can."
 flavor_crd.2.b: "I wonder how a cat life would be in the world largest litter box."
 flavor_crd.2.c: "On a second thought... Orin should stay at home."
 flavor_crd.3.t: "The Oni and [Root.GetName]"
 flavor_crd.3.desc: "The oni used to be our subject only just in name. While they were technically our vassal they were practically a complete autonomous state. This has changed though when we reached our diplomatic hand (with some sake smell too) to them. After hours of discussions and tavern brawls, the oni have decided to support us militarily and become our de facto vassal too. However, they will need quite some time to get used to these new circumstances..."
 flavor_crd.3.a: "These are great news!"
 flavor_crd.3.a.tt: "§Y[ONI.GetName]§! gets a Truce with [Root.GetName] for §Y5 Years§! and §R+150.0%§! Liberty Desire due to the sudden change of power relations."
 flavor_crd.6.t: "Utsuho Reiuji in India"
 flavor_crd.6.desc: "There are four kinds of hell: literally hell, the desert hell, the arctic hell ... and the green hell - and Utsuho has decided for the fourth. While the temperature is not as bad as in Former Hell, the wildlife and the jungles proof to be quite tricky to handle.\nBut it was Utsuho's decision to see out the flame god and as such she organized the establishment of a base in North India."
 flavor_crd.6.a: "Well... she didn't organize it. She let other do it for her."
 flavor_crd.6.b: "I wonder how this bird brain will do in India."
 flavor_crd.6.c: "No. You bird brain should rather stay in the fusion reactor."
 flavor_crd.8.t: "Stubborn Scarlets"
 flavor_crd.8.desc.a: "The Scarlet Devil Mansion is ruled technically under our rule, but practically, it is ruled Remilia Scarlet. Usually it wouldn't make much difference as vassals are just an extension of one's power, but Remilia is not as obedient as a vassal should be - and as such all of the Scarlet Lands refuse to acknowledge the authority of [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 flavor_crd.8.desc.b: "The Scarlet Lands are under our control. However, their residents refuse with all means to serve us. They see us as oppressors and will be nothing but dead space to us."
 flavor_crd.8.a: "Accursed be these Scarlets."
 flavor_crd.8.a.tt: "All provinces in the areas §YScarlet Devil Mansion§!, §YScarlet Land§! and §YScarlet Mountain§!, which are owned by us or by our subject, which is not [SCR.GetName], get '§YNot my Mistress§!' until the §YScarlets have been appeased§!, giving the following effects:\nLocal Unrest: §R+1.00§!\nMinimum Local Autonomy: §R+95.00§!"
 flavor_crd.8.a.ct: "[SCR.GetName] will refuse to aid [Root.Monarch.GetName] in any wars and will not pay any tribute. This will go until [SCR.Monarch.GetName] and [SCR.Monarch.GetHerHis] family and subjects have been §Yappeased§!."
 flavor_crd.11.t: "Remilia recognizes [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s Authority"
 flavor_crd.11.desc.a: "Remilia Scarlet is very pride person, which makes dealing with her really difficult at times. But she respects who are on her level and can hold their ground against her - be it in a danmaku battle, a fight of finesse and diplomacy or the solving of the Scarlet Mist Incident. [Root.Monarch.GetName] managed to outwit her and win against Remilia in any way possible. Ever since, Remilia has become more calmer ... and more childish. Apparently, she feels like a great burden has been lifted of her and now she enjoys her life within the Scarlet Devil Mansion."
 flavor_crd.11.desc.b: "The Scarlet Devil Mansion is like a family - and only members of the family can find their way into it. But through show of strength and carefulness, the residents of the Scarlet Devil Mansion slowly learned to accept and even to invite [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Of course the Scarlet Devil won't let go off her pride, but she seems to enjoy her time of less responsibility."
 flavor_crd.11.a: "This vampire really is a pain in the neck..."
 flavor_crd.11.a.tt: "Provinces in §YScarlet Land§!, §YScarlet Mountain§! and §YScarlet Devil Mansion§! owned by us or by any subject will no longer be affected by the modifier '§YNot my Mistress§!'."
 flavor_crd.11.a.ct: "[SCR.GetName] will now be obedient towards [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"
 flavor_crd.12.t: "The Vampire and the Mind Reader"
 flavor_crd.12.desc: "Months have passed since Remilia stepped down as the ruler of Scarlet Realm. Since then, she has started to see more of Gensokyo and even go on or another adventure. Over the time, the once so childish vampire matured... at least personality wise. Due to her development in character, Remilia started to take a more serious tone towards governing the Scarlet Devil Mansion. She started to meet with Satori a lot more recently too. While the chat tends to be rather formal, Satori occasionally taps into Remilia's mind. What might Remilia think about right now?"
 flavor_crd.12.a: "She thinks I am cute."
 flavor_crd.12.b: "She thinks how she should spend more time with her family."
 flavor_crd.13.t: "The little Sisters of Two Dynasties"
 flavor_crd.13.desc: "Unlike Remilia and Satori, the relationship between Flandre and Koishi has always been on friendly terms - even if it is a very unknown friendship. After all, only a handful people can even recognize Koishi so it is no surprise that she always managed to bypass the guard of the Scarlet Devil Mansion and visit her good friend Flandre.\nBefore the conquest of Scarlet Devil Mansion, Koishi spent a lot of time with Flandre, but now she is in a position, where so much weight is on her shoulders and as such the time to play with Flandre has been significantly rarer, which saddens Koishi. However, one day, Koishi stormed into the throne room and had the brilliant idea of how to get more play time together! And so, Koishi proposed to Flandre in public, but only the two of them know what's going on while everyone else notice nothing ... well... except for mistress Satori..."
 flavor_crd.13.a: "I just pretend I didn't see Koishi doing this."
 flavor_crd.13.b: "\"Ahem... Koishi...\""
 flavor_crd.14.t: "Remilia remains unimpressed"
 flavor_crd.14.desc: "All of the Scarlet Devil Mansion and its land are under our control ... and yet Remilia keeps sitting on her throne with a taunting smug in her face. She states only one demand: in order for her to acknowledge [Root.Monarch.GetName], she needs to be defeated by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] in a personal fight. Until then she sees no reason to follow any of our orders."
 flavor_crd.14.a: "A fight... of course the Scarlet Devil wants a fight..."
 flavor_crd.14.a.tt: "Enable the Diplomatic Danmaku Fight against §YRemilia§!"
 flavor_crd.15.t: "Fight against the Scarlet Devil"
 flavor_crd.15.desc: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] usually avoids direct confrontations and prefers to let work be done through more subtle methods. But Remilia Scarlet is a special case. All mind tricks have failed, any way to appease her just made her more smug and in the end there is only the Danmaku Battle as a way to solve this issue. Although Remilia and [Root.Monarch.GetName] are proud overlords and would never put themselves on the same level as the other, they do still show respect to each other - from mansion owner to mansion owner. As a result of that, the epic battle between these two is in fact a Diplomatic Danmaku Battle."
 flavor_crd.15.a: "Bats like you should have stayed in caves, Remilia."
 flavor_crd.15.a.tt: "§YThis will trigger a \"Diplomatic Danmaku Fight\" between [Root.Monarch.GetName] and Remilia!§!"
 flavor_crd.15.b: "You know what? Words are not enough for her to reach. Danmaku do however."
 flavor_crd.15.b.tt: "§YThis will trigger a Danmaku Fight between [Root.Monarch.GetName] and Remilia!§!"
 flavor_crd.16.t: "Victory over Remilia!"
 flavor_crd.16.desc: "Danmaku and rude words flew through the room constantly, and this for hours. But in the end Remilia had to submit to the mental fortitude and mind reading abilities of [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 flavor_crd.16.a: "Finally. Arguing with her was a bore."
 flavor_crd.16.a.tt: "Remilia has been §Ydefeated§! in a Diplomatic Danmaku Fight."
 flavor_crd.17.t: "Defeat against Remilia"
 flavor_crd.17.desc: "Although [Root.Monarch.GetName] had good attacks, Remilia knew how to counter them just too well. \"You fight like a peasant\" was only countered with Remilia's \"How fitting. You are fighting just like a cow.\" In the end, it was [Root.Monarch.GetName] who had to submit."
 flavor_crd.17.a: "This is not the end..."
 flavor_crd.17.a.tt: "You can encounter Remilia §Y5 Years§! later again."
 flavor_crd.20.t: "Koishi and the Mask of Hope"
 flavor_crd.20.desc: "Getting the Mask of Hope was an easy task for Satori. After all, what is a tsukumogami to a satori?\nSatori placed the mask on Koishi's table in her room. Like usual, there is no sign of Koishi. Instead, there was a feeling of unease... Satori turned around and saw the table being completely empty again."
 flavor_crd.20.a: "I have a bad feeling now..."
 flavor_crd.20.a.tt: "Koishi is very thankful to Satori."
 ###DETECTIVE SATORI###
 flavor_crd.30.t: "The new Office"
 flavor_crd.30.desc: "There I was, in my new open office. It was just a room in my very own mansion, but I wanted it like so. I need to separate my daily life and my new hobby.\nIt is a neat office. Nothing too fancy - again, I need to separate life and hobby.\nI sit into my chair at the table and look through the papers lying on it. My cat was so nice and wanted to help, so she collected whatever she could find. Orin is the only one I can trust with this kind of job. Her cat features cause sympathy by humans and youkai alike...\nPff... both are just the worst...\n\nI go through the files, but nothing all too particularly attracts my attention. All things the yama will probably have covered already by now...\nHowever... there is one case, which got my attention. \"BREAKING NEWS - MURDER ATTEMPT AT THE SCARLET DEVIL MANSION!\". It's a tengu newspaper, so the content is always a little bit... creative. But this one -- this seems like a serious case. I should start my career with this one."
 flavor_crd.30.a: "But first, I should talk with Orin."
 flavor_crd.30.a.tt: "Detective Satori will start her very first case!"
 flavor_crd.31.t: "The Detective's Assistant"
 flavor_crd.31.desc: "Standing in my office, my hell cat pet Orin greets me with her most enthusiastic voice pitch she can do. Seems like she is more than eager to help me.\n\"Hellllloooo master! You called me? How can I help you??\" Her good mood is kinda contagious. I have troubles to keep a serious face... \"Yes, I did, my little cat. Did you hear of this incident?\" I hold the files of Scarlet Devil Mansion murder case in my hand. Orin tilts her head as usual when she is getting something asked. \"Nyes, I heard about it. I think their librarian has been hit. No idea how though.\" Orin replied. \"That's why I called you. I need somebody who can go to the mansion on my half and talk with the residents.\" I could go there myself, but I have a realm to take care of too... and honestly, I don't want to hear the judging minds of the vampire and her lackeys unless I absolutely need to.\nOrin meows. \"Okaaay. I will do this for you! You can count on me, master!\""
 flavor_crd.31.a: "What a good cat."
 flavor_crd.32.t: "Orin Report - Interview with the SDM"
 flavor_crd.32.desc: "Sitting in the office and enjoying some good water. For some reason, everyone assumes a detective should be some kind of drunkard. Hmpf... stereotypes.\n\n<Master will be very happy with what I found!!> I hear the mind of somebody, approaching my office. It can only be-\n\"MAAAAASTERRR! I bring news!\" \"Oh, what did you find, Orin?\"\nOrin goes into long detail about how she has talked with the residents of the Scarlet Devil Mansion. I glance out of the window while she talks. And talks. And talks. I wish she would be more on point with her explanations, but oh well... that happens if you send somebody else on your behalf for the interviews...\nHowever, she still brings some good clues about the attempted murder of §BPatchouli Knowledge§!. At the location of the crime, the §GLibrary§!, Orin found a §Rbunch of books§! lying on the floor - like somebody tried to find a specific tome.\nAt the table where Patchouli sat, there is a §Rbroken cup with remaining coffee§! - probably the murder weapon.\nIn an interview with §BMeiling Hong§!, it got revealed that there has been no known visitor in the mansion during the incident - but well, Meiling was asleep during the events according to her. However, she also notes how §BRemilia Scarlet§! liked to spend a lot of time with Patchouli and that §BSakuya Izayoi§! could have felt §Rneglected§!.\nAfterwards, my pet talked with §BReimu Hakurei§! and §BMarisa Kirisame§!, but nothing of value came out of this interview except that Marisa might have been interested in the §Rbooks of the library§! and that Reimu was complaining about a §Rlack of donations§! in recent times.."
 flavor_crd.32.a: "§TMarisa§! is a book thief. To get away with her theft, she murders Patchouli."
 flavor_crd.32.a.tt: "Rin Kaenbyou will accuse §TMarisa Kirisame§! for the murder attempt on Patchouli Knowledge."
 flavor_crd.32.b: "§TReimu§! is a youkai extinctor. Patchouli is a youkai witch. Case closed."
 flavor_crd.32.b.tt: "Rin Kaenbyou will accuse §TReimu Hakurei§! for the murder attempt on Patchouli Knowledge."

 flavor_crd.33.t: "Fairy Nationalism Rises"
 flavor_crd.33.desc: "The files stack on my desk - all potential clues and suspects in the murder attempt of Patchouli Knowledge. However, a few paper are new. Apparently, Orin wanted me to read them... hmm...\n\"FAIRY NATIONALISM RISES - CIRNO DEMANDS RIGHTS FOR FAIRIES\" Apparently, the little vassal Remilia has is getting ballsy ... and reckless. This ice fairy has enough of her and her people being \"subjugated by the evil vampire\". The last time I checked, all the fairies in the Scarlet Devil Mansion were officially hired and only the violent fairies stayed out and became vassals.\nEhh... whatever. I wasn't thinking too much about this article until out of the sudden I found a little detail on the image of the newspaper. §BCirno§! was holding a frozen, §RGolden poison frog§! - its poison is easily capable of killing somebody with heart failure..."
 flavor_crd.33.a: "I wonder if the ice fairy is smarter than she appears like..."
 flavor_crd.34.t: "The great Accusation"
 flavor_crd.34.desc.a: "Another day at the office. Former Hell is going well at least and nothing of too much of concern is happening - perfect conditions to hear the report Orin is giving me now. I told her to accuse §BMarisa§! in front of all the suspects. The shock was, of course, big.\nWhen Orin announced it was Marisa, the suspects went into a heated discussion - and Marisa was of course defending herself as good as she could. But these books on the ground don't lie. In the night of the murder attempt, Marisa prepared a coffee with one of the many poisonous mushrooms of the Forest of Magic and entered the library. Because Meiling was sleeping at her job, she had it quite easy. Her goal was actually to take some books and leave, but Patchouli stood in her way. Instead of a danmaku fight, which could have caught the attention of the other residents, Marisa decided to use one of her poisons and sold it as a good coffee for Patchouli. They talked with each other until Patchouli fall into a coma - the perfect chance to get away with the books.\nOf course Marisa denied the accusation Orin made, but it was too late and she was thrown into the basement."
 flavor_crd.34.desc.b: "Another day at the office. Former Hell is going well at least and nothing of too much of concern is happening - perfect conditions to hear the report Orin is giving me now. I told her to accuse §BReimu§! in front of all the suspects. The shock was, of course, big.\nWhen Orin announced it was Reimu, the suspects gasped. However, I doubt Reimu was the true killer but was just hired to murder - another youkai hunting contract to get her donation box full. She flew into the mansion, burst into the library - the reason for the books on the ground - and interrupted Patchouli during her coffee break. Before she was able to react, Reimu used one of her special danmaku to instantly kill Patchouli.\nUnfortunately for her, Patchouli survived and now the truth came out - and worst of all for her: her donation box will remain empty as she gets thrown into the basement."
 flavor_crd.34.desc.c: "Another day at the office. Former Hell is going well at least and nothing of too much of concern is happening - perfect conditions to hear the report Orin is giving me now. I told her to accuse §BSakuya§! in front of all the suspects. The shock was, of course, big.\nWhen Orin announced it was Sakuya, the residents were just horrified. The very house maid, who keeps everything in the mansion in check is the assaulter on Patchouli. She had the means as she can stop time and prepares all the food and drinks of the mansion. She has a reason as she grew jealous of the friendship between her mistress and Patchouli and she had the opportunities as Patchouli is always alone in the library. Sakuya couldn't even defend herself and got quickly thrown into the basement."
 flavor_crd.34.desc.d: "Another day at the office. Former Hell is going well at least and nothing of too much of concern is happening - perfect conditions to hear the report Orin is giving me now. I told her to accuse §BCirno§! in front of all the suspects. The shock was, of course, big.\nWhen Orin announced it was Cirno, the residents were very much confused. How could have a dumb fairy done this? What they forget is that Cirno and her fairy accomplices have been trying to become independent for quite some time and a act of terror against the Scarlet Devil Mansion would be the message a fairy would send. Additionally, fairies are small and easy to overlook them AND Cirno has access to poisonous frogs - means, reasons and opportunities exist for her.\nCirno got quickly persecuted and has been thrown into the basement ever since."
 flavor_crd.34.a: "Something tells me this case is not finished yet jet though."
 flavor_crd.35.t: "Patchouli wakes up!"
 flavor_crd.35.desc: "In a great twist of events, §BPatchouli Knowledge§! wakes up from her coma. Well... to be frank: it wasn't quite surprising. Orin told me she would wake up eventually. What I did not expect though was that she knows who was the assaulter. It was none other than §BSakuya Izayoi§! herself!"

Yeah, I heard it.\" Orin has a surprised face for a few seconds. I guess she need some time to process before she realized. \"Nyes, I forgot. Mindreading!\" Orin gives me her notes. \"Patchouli has woken up and has accused Sakuya immediately for the attempted murder! You can see what she have done to her in the files!\" I read through Orin's notebook. \"So, they locked Sakuya in the basement, did they?\" Orin confirms my question and remarks my - naturally - amazing detective skills.\nHowever, something seems off. Sakuya is too ... defensive regarding the position. Additionally, they have been some news from my very own realm too lately. I should send Orin back to the SDM for further investigations for now."

They are Orin's as it has many \"nyan\" in them - as usual.\n<Master will not be too happy to hear about that...> Orin enters my office. \"Master, I have-\"- \"Bad news? Yeah, I heard it.\" Orin has a surprised face for a few seconds. I guess she need some time to process before she realized. \"Nyes, I forgot. Mindreading!\" Orin gives me her notes. \"Patchouli has woken up and has accused Sakuya immediately for the attempted murder. It seems like our previous suspect was not the culprit... You can see what she have done to her in the files!\" I read through Orin's notebook. \"So, they locked Sakuya in the basement and released the previous suspect, did they?\" Orin confirms my question. Well, having the wrong suspect accuses happens. A small blow to my reputation, but whatever.\nStill... something seems off. Sakuya is too ... defensive regarding the position. Additionally, they have been some news from my very own realm too lately. I should send Orin back to the SDM for further investigations for now."

 flavor_crd.41.desc: "The rain splashes against my window while I am looking out. I love the mansion and the office. I can oversee the whole underworld and see all these lights go on during night - and it looks especially wonderful during rain. ... huh, rain. In the underworld, where you cannot see the sky anyway. If this was fiction, one would think that this is must be massively inconsistent... but Gensokyo was never a world of reason and logic.\nThe sounds of the rain drops fill the room. I glance over my table and see yet again a new file. This time, it is a newspaper from a much more reliable source. \"ONIN NEWS - EVIL POSSESSIVE SPIRIT ON THE LOOSE\" I read through the news. While oni have no talent in the artistic writing, they are at least on point and honest - something I appreciate quite a lot. Seems like some evil spirit escaped Former Hell and is on a rampage - or at least that's what the oni think about. Sadly, these poor brutes have no idea what actually goes on.\n\"This reminds me...\" I put the news on the table again and look through some older files - a case which has not been resolved. An evil spirit from the north managed to infiltrate Chireiden and attempted to free §Rsome of her kind§!. This spirit, §BMima§!, has been seen at the location of crime, but was never able to be captured. Little did we know that she actually succeeded in freeing §Bone evil spirit§!, who is now looming the exit of Former Hell.\n\"Wait a minute...\" A bad feeling comes over me.

I started with this tradition ever since my little sister threw away her gift. For what? Just so she can't hear bad minds. Now she is nothing more but a cripple... a cripple, who cannot even think for herself. Thinking about §BKoishi§! always makes me sad. She could have been just as amazing as I am...\nStill, I love her with all of my heart and wish only the best for her. If she thinks closing the third eye is the best for her then so be it. All I want is her to be happy and being well. Because of that, I go around the mansion and check if she is okay.\n*Sigh* And as usual, I find no trace of her. Again. I wonder sometimes if her ability to §Rcontrol subconscious§! mad her invisible to me like for anyone else. But no, as a satori, I am above such weakness.\nHuh... however, nobody else is. If Koishi want, she could easily sneak into a mansion and poison somebody. And her only reason for doing was because her gut feeling told her to do so.\nWhat are you thinking now, Satori? No, I will not start suspecting my very own sister."

The cause of the coma seem to be §Ra cup of tea§!. Same symptoms too.\nI close the notebook. Who could have done it this time? It can't be Sakuya as she was in the basement...\nI glance at the second notebook from Orin, which has the inscription \"Emergency\". Orin is usually very much a happy-go-lucky cat, so seeing her writing something as dramatic as that is really unusual.\nI open her second notebook and read through the fuzzy lines. Apparently, Sakuya escaped the basement and fled to the ... kitchen? Huh... Orin beliefs Sakuya was destroying evidences... While reading even more, Orin corrects herself that the cup of tea is, in fact, not poisoned at all... Orin also notes that there was somebody else in the basement too - §BFlandre Scarlet§!, the little sister of Remilia.\nHmm...

Huh... that's interesting.\n\"Can you please tell me what you have witnessed on the day of the crime?\" Patchouli glares at Sakuya with a sinister view. <It was a normal day like any other. I was enjoying a few new books regarding Magic Theories. I ordered a §Rcoffee§! from §BSakuya§! earlier. After around 15 minutes, she appeared with a cup of coffee and gave it to me. I was foolish and just drank it. My body felt heavy and I felt into a coma. The last thing I saw was her... smiling shamelessly.> \"I see.

Reimu and Marisa couldn't have done this as neither of them could §Rsteal somebody's magic§!. Additionally, the tea was made by Meiling herself, so it couldn't have been poisoned.\nRemilia can't be the culprit as she have been busy governing the mansion during the times in question.

Some time prior the incident here in the Scarlet Devil Mansion, an evil ghost infiltrated Former Hell and tried to free some evil spirits. While Mima was able to escape, none of the inmates she intended to rescue were freed. Or at least so we thought. Apparently an evil spirit - an eternal criminal - managed to escape shortly before Patchouli has been targeted.

I think something was up with Koishi lately and her wish visit her playmate made her uncontrollable abilities even stronger. All I can remember clearly is that I tried to explain how this all happened, but... Koishi just flapped with her arms and people have forgotten what was going on here for the last few weeks. What a very anticlimactic ending of my very first case, but at least I know the truth.\nKoishi went without my knowledge to the Scarlet Devil Mansion and slipped through the gate. She was playing with Flandre - the only other person, who can actually remember her. After a few danmaku fights for fun, Koishi has become very thirsty and asked Sakuya for a drink. Due to Koishi's mind manipulative abilities, Sakuya believed she was making coffee for Patchouli.

 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.100.desc: "Alright, human, listen up! I will explain to you how Mayohiga operates!\nUnlike these barbaric neighbors you have, your realm - Mayohiga - doesn't use its own troops and soldiers for fighting. Instead we have Daimyos - a bunch of vassals who think they have a free will, but are in the end our subjects. They can declare wars on their own and expand without us having to support them. That comes however with the drawback that they might grow too rapidly, which makes them think they can take on with you. In such cases you have the option to either demand their collapse (which of course will displease them) or make them your March. Marches are much more obedient and don't cause as much trouble, but will occupy one of your March Slots. If you have more marches than March Slots, your marches will get the choice to either revert back to daimyo - and repeat this cycle - or will declare independence war upon you. So be sure you are using your marches wisely.\nOther than that your realm is pretty easy to handle. Any questions?"

Remilia and I made a contract not a long time ago: I allow her to start a new life in Gensokyo and she keeps things interesting here. But apparently I became a rival of her without my knowledge why or since when. Usually I don't care if I get on the wrong side of anybody, but with a vampire child on a throne things can go south pretty fast - especially if said vampire child releases a dangerous Scarlet Mist to boost her ego.\nWell, to bad about her ego, because now her precious Mansion is under my control. I think I will let you decide how I should handle this brat."

 flavor_mhg.7.desc: "Over a thousand years ago, the youkai of this planet went to war against the Lunarians of the Moon - and I was the one who declared war and led the armies. This war ended in a complete catastrophe and the youkai had to retreat. I justified the invasion with a hunger of the Lunarian power, but I intended a different goal to achieve. You see, I already knew from the get-go that this war will end in a defeat and I wanted to demonstrate to youkai that the idea of conquest is bad.\nIt worked for a long time and Gensokyo was peaceful. Well, WAS. Now in Gensokyo everyone declares war on each other, but this wasn't my main concern.\nIn Eientei, there lives a Lunarian who can clearly remember the terror of war on the moon. In the chaos of today's Gensokyo, this Lunarian could have tried to contact their home and prepare a revenge invasion of Gensokyo. I couldn't afford such a threat, which is why a complete annihilation of Eientei was required. Also, I am not a good loser, but this a completely different topic..."

 flavor_mhg.8.desc: "The Hakurei Barrier was an old shield, which prevented all foreign forces from interacting with Gensokyo. It made the continent invisible, unreachable for every non-Gensokyan and it was unbreakable. But not all things can exist forever and the Barrier broke, allowing the Outworld to see Gensokyo and vice versa. This change from complete isolation allowed Gensokyo to learn from the Outworld ideas, but it also made a lot of youkai anxious. The peace of Gensokyo was gone and the little realms started to kill each other.\n\nBut fortunately the glorious nation of [Root.GetName] managed to restore the Hakurei Barrier and gained with it enough authority to demand every Gensokyan nation to become its tributary! A new era has started in Gensokyo and it remains to be seen whether the new overlord of Gensokyo can bring back peace to Gensokyo!"
 flavor_mhg.8.a: "A new era indeed."

 flavor_mhg.9.t: "Symbolic Authority"
 flavor_mhg.9.desc: "It works! The news about the new Barrier is spreading throughout Gensokyo! It will take some time, but sooner or later these kids acknowledge my authority again! You see, the many realm leaders already had their conflicts with each other, but because of my role as Gensokyo's guardian they always avoided war. They feared my authority even if I was asleep. The destruction of the previous Barrier was a sign for many rulers here that I \"failed\" my job and therefore I don't have the right to manage the intern problems of Gensokyo. But now the Barrier is back..."
 flavor_mhg.9.a: "Does it mean there will be peace again?"
 flavor_mhg.9.a.tt: "Yes, but not now. And most certainly not within the next two centuries. It will take a lot of time and work, but someday peace and tranquility will return to Gensokyo. Until then we have only the support of my people and good relations with every Gensokyan nation. Make the best of it, human."

 flavor_mhg.11.desc: "The realm of the Aztecs was once a major local power in Central America, a power who waged its infamous flower wars and sacrificed people. In history, the terrifying Aztecs got annihilated by the Spaniards.\nIn this timeline, however, the Aztecs are still alive - more and less - and became our subjects. For me, humans are only humans and I don't care what shall happen to these funny bush men. But for this task, I have you, player. Should I modernize this tribe nation and convert them to the Gensokyan standards? Or should they remain our little native slaves?"

It almost feels like I've gone back in time again...\nBut enough of this distraction. You and I have to find a \"Blood God\". The \"\" are needed, because this \"God\" is an imposter, who collects tons of blood for some wicked magic, which protects her from my boundary manipulations. Usually I wouldn't care if a youkai kills some humans, but this one is special: 1., this youkai is gone rogue, which means she knows about Gensokyo and could cause more chaos with that knowledge than she knows, which leads us to \n2. She demands way too many sacrifices - even for Aztec standards. She attracts far too much attention from the humans.\nAnd now to the last point 3) I don't like it when somebody can hide from my boundary abilities. She has to go. I know she is here somewhere, but I am not sure where exactly. She is either in Mexico, in Cholula or in Sotuta.

I was just humming Preußens Gloria. You can say whatever you want about Prussians, but you have to admit that their military march is really catchy... Ok, back to business: I see you conquered the lovely city of Königsberg so we have now a good supply of well trained mercs. I have thought about it and I think it would be more fun if we had Prussia as a puppet state. I mean, mercenaries can be really strong, but nothing can really beat Prussian discipline - well, apart from Remilia's military state experiment.\nIf you think Prussia is a little bit too ordinary I could also bring the Teutons back. What would you love to see?"
 flavor_mhg.42.a: "A Prussian subject sounds fun indeed. I didn't know you are a wehraboo by the way..."

She improves their arsenal and the humans leave her alone. It is good to see her doing well.\nAnd Apparently the enchanter of the ice was happy to see me too! She gave me some documents about the Kalmar Union I lost, some enchanted weapons for our army and navy!"
 flavor_mhg.43.a: "Say, why isn't this powerful youkai in Gensokyo yet?"
 flavor_mhg.43.a.tt: "Because she doesn't want to live there. You see, Gensokyo is a safe haven for all kinds of youkai, but nobody is forced to live there - especially if you don't draw much attention to you in the Outworld. My enchanter friend lived in Scandinavia for so long she became part of the local myths - and she is happy about it."

Fortunately she and I made a pact long ago: if Yuyuko begins to become a threat to Gensokyo I am allowed to claim her throne until she calms down. Of course the pact goes the other way too.\nPlease, let me talk to her. I want to see if she is still corrupted by the tree or not.

But these times were of short duration and Kaguya had to move on. As a farewell, Kaguya sent a letter to the Emperor as well as the little bit of what was left of the Hourai potion.\nKaguya never learnt of what has happened with the man until she set her foot on Mount Fuji today. She found an ancient, charred letter from her friend of the past as well as what appears to be the burned remains of the Hourai potion.

That would be an action she immediately regretted when she saw her old rival in a wedding dress. “Greetings my dear prince~” cooed the princess. Mokou felt her blood vessel about to burst, but with Herculean strength, she inquired without resorting to violence. “Explain yourself. NOW!”. Kaguya merely widened her smile. “Now, now, that's no way to talk to your wife~”. At times like these, Mokou wondered whether the term pyrrhic victory could be renamed after herself. Perhaps she'd talk to Keine about it. Her desperate attempt to ignore the problem in front of her was destroyed when she spoke up once more. “You don't sound happy at all…. but then, why else did you do the impossible tasks?” She looked crestfallen, a sharp contrast to how she was a few moments before. Mokou wondered if that girl existed solely to ruin her life. Seeing the ever-confident Kaguya this broken awoke a feeling in Mokou she did not know existed. Nothing was right about this; it was new and undiscovered ground. She cursed the princess internally for always finding a way to win and spoke up. “It would bring dishonor to the Fujiwara to break our word. Call Keine and Eirin to prepare.” Kaguya instantly brightened up, and rushed to hug Mokou, ending up tackling her to her bed.

 flavor_cin.24.desc: "Cirno and Clownpiece had a long history of rivalry, but it never came down to an actual fight - until this day! In the first time of Fairy history a fight broke out, which takes more than 20 seconds to finish! During the long danmaku fight both fairies went out of magic to use any danmaku so they even started going into melee and fought the last five minutes with bare fists! In the end though, Cirno managed to beat Clownpiece and punched her often enough that Clownpiece capitulates!"
 flavor_cin.24.a: "You deserved it, Clownpiece! You sold your people to Junko, now you've paid the price!"
 flavor_cin.24.a.tt: "After this complete beat down, Clownpiece decided to repent for her sins and swore to serve us as a general!"
 flavor_cin.25.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s Beat down"

 flavor_cin.26.t: "Defeat of the Fairy Slayer"
 flavor_cin.26.desc: "Although the numbers of fairy kills is much higher for Reimu, Marisa, Sanae and Sakuya, none of them were as painful and efficient than Youmu Konpaku! This evil half-ghost does no know mercy in combat and as such we repaid these crimes against her! Although many fairies died in the battle again Youmu, in the end we managed to defeat her and imprison her! Now her fighting techniques will be taught to our troops while she enjoys watering some ice flowers!"

Ever since we lost more and more foothold to a vampire, humans and magicians. But now, with the reconquest of our beloved island, we can now fully claim that things go better for Fairy kind!"

 flavor_cin.28.a: "Finally free from the Vampire's grasp!"

[Root.Monarch.GetName] desires to change this and tries to make Cirinia's troops into a professional army. Yet [Root.Monarch.GetName] lacks the knowledge how to train, which means [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has to experiment with the many training methods..."
 flavor_cin.125.a: "Well, let the soldiers fight against each other on top of a volcano to make them stronger!"
 flavor_cin.125.b: "A battle royal wasn't the best idea. How about they just drill together with a general?"

 flavor_lil.1.t: "A convenient Alliance"
 flavor_lil.1.desc: "Lily was the whole day busy. She learned different ways of wording her plea, she memorized everything what Satori could appeal - yet the fear still sits deep in her. Satori has a notorious reputation of letting annoying fairies become the new servants of her hell cat pet...\nThe moment has come and Lily entered the secretive mansion \"Chireiden\"..."
 flavor_lil.1.a: "Okay, Lily, you can do it!"
 flavor_lil.1.a.tt: "Lily will meet Satori in Chireiden and tries to convince her for an alliance.\nIf our relations with Chireiden are well enough Satori might consider allying with us - but we will have to fulfill her expectations."
 flavor_lil.1.b: "On second thought... Satori is too scary..."
 flavor_lil.1.b.tt: "Lily will avoid Satori. As such, we will get no chance for an alliance with Chireiden, but we will not have any obligations to Satori."
 flavor_lil.2.t: "The Pleas of a Fairy"
 flavor_lil.2.desc: "Satori doesn't get visitors that regularly and when some then they are usually some incident investigators. Because of that, Satori was quite surprised when a simple-minded fairy - Lily White to be more precise - entered her mansion. The spring fairy stuttered and her fear was quite visible; she was unable to say a decent word. Luckily for her, our good mistress is a mind reader. After searching in Lily's minds, Satori learns that this weak fairy seeks Chireiden's support against Remilia Scarlet.\nWhile Lily is very unimpressive, her little home does actually have strategic value. In case of a war with Scarlet Realm, Lily will us serve as a meat shield against Remilia's forces and maybe she will even become our vassal when feels safe enough again..."
 flavor_lil.2.a: "Hmmm... Orin mentioned that she could use more zombie fairies."
 flavor_lil.2.a.tt: "We will support Lily in her strive to fight against Remilia. In return we will be able to demand her absolute obedience when Remilia has been neutralized."
 flavor_lil.2.b: "She is a fairy. A waste of time and energy. She can seek her support elsewhere."
 flavor_lil.2.b.tt: "We will miss the chance of a potential new subject, but we will not have to support Lily."
 flavor_lil.3.t: "Satori accepts the Alliance"
 flavor_lil.3.desc: "Our good fairy lady managed the unthinkable: she secured an alliance with Satori Komeiji! However, Satori emphasized that our realm shall repay the security one day. But compared to the threat Remilia poses it is a worthy price to pay..."
 flavor_lil.3.a: "Let's just hope Satori doesn't back out."
 flavor_lil.4.t: "Satori declines the Alliance"
 flavor_lil.4.desc: "Despite Lily's best attempts, Satori was not convinced by our beloved ruler. She called Lily as \"replaceable\" and \"useless\" and sent her packing! Even though we lack the power now, we will not forget this insult and will repay it to her!"
 flavor_lil.4.a: "She is so mean..."
 flavor_lil.5.t: "Komeiji's Demand"
 flavor_lil.5.desc: "It has been done! The Scarlet Devil has been defeated and her mansion has been liberated from the vampires! The many fairy maidens joined now our cause while of the residents every sign has been missing.\nWhile these are great news for Lily, they also mean something more worrisome: our good fairy lady made a pact with Satori Komeiji for the safety of [Root.GetName]. In return, the fairies of [Root.GetName] serve Satori in her campaign shall the Scarlet Devil be eliminated - and now Satori reminds Lily of this pact quite drastically.\nLily now has to decide if she wants our realm to submit to the satori or if she wants us to deny this pact and risk a war against Chireiden..."
 flavor_lil.5.a: "Chireiden is our future. We have to serve Satori for my people's safety."

 flavor_lil.8.t: "The Corruption of Saigyou Ayakashi"
 flavor_lil.8.desc: "While the saved spring power of the tree enhanced Lily, a darkness has been growing in our beloved Mistress! Saigyou Ayakashi is resisting and so collected all the negative emotions our mistress had in her life. In a moment of unwariness, the dark energy got unleashed and a new persona has risen out of Lily: a doppelganger of her, but in complete black and with a look of decay in her eyes!"
 flavor_lil.8.a: "We have to stop her before she spreads the corruption!"

 flavor_lil.9.t: "Lily Black, the Evil Side of Lily"
 flavor_lil.9.desc: "Unlike any other fairy, Lily Black has an unnatural aura; one, which completely negates the beauty of spring and let even the prettiest flowers rot. She is a fairy, but not one of nature but one of the demon tree Saigyou. If she is left unchecked, the fairies of Gensokyo might end up being absorbed and their life essences being used for the demon tree! [Root.Monarch.GetName] has to face her and defeat this agent of corruptness!"

 flavor_lil.12.desc: "With the defeat of Lily Black, life has begun to bloom next to the Demon Tree again! Although the tree will always remain a threat in Gensokyo and the evil within is not destroyable, we at least managed to seal it away. However, the remaining spring energy of the tree has been freed! Now it is up to Lily to harness it and bring harmony and prosperity to our realm!"
 flavor_lil.12.a: "It will be a pleasure!"
 flavor_lil.13.t: "Eternal Spring"
 flavor_lil.13.desc: "It is done! Lily managed to harness the Spring Power from the evil demon tree and used it to bring prosperity to our people in Gensokyo! We have ensured that nobody will ever again try to steal Spring and let the world stay in eternal ice and darkness and used its power to do good things! Now Lily can focus on her actual duty which is letting people know that the best season of the year has come!"

However, when Star has stolen one of Kaguya's outfits and imitated her in the Human Capital, she felt quite provoked and like she has been made fun of. This changed though when Star came to her with a rather upset face and told her about what she has experienced in the Human Capital. From personal experience, Kaguya knows too well how creepy humans can be and decided to not have any grudges against Star anymore.

She often got claimed as being \"stupid\" for a fairy, yet all the logical tasks are burdened on her shoulders - like forming a government where fairies can truly be free from all the political problems. As she looked at the Misty Sea she suddenly got an idea!\nLuna remembers that the humans published a book about from famous pirates of the island called \"Tsushima\". These pirates had only to worry about their own fun and weren't forced to think too much - perfect for a fairy culture based on pranks and stealing! At the next day she presented her idea to the other two fairies. Their excitement was far beyond than what Luna has expected."

What was less expected was the total and utter destruction of the city that took place. Refusing to follow orders our fairy soldiers descended upon the helpless burghers, doing despicable things and ruining the area for a long time to come. Fortunately, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is present and can stop the madness."

It was nobody else than [From.Monarch.GetName] [From.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself], the servant of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s good friend Hecatia and now our subject. The reason for her visit was a proposal: [From.Monarch.GetName] wants to continue helping us against the Lunarians. However, [From.Monarch.GetSheHe] wishes to help us in [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] own, independent ways. While it means a lost of a subject it would mean for us a powerful ally..."

After that, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] asked if Hecatia could loosen her grip over [Root.GetName]. Although the relationship between Hecatia and Clownpiece was of a goddess and her subject, it seemed more like a mother-daughter relationship. Because of that, Hecatia had no troubles with giving her favorite fairy more freedom.\nHowever, the question of religion was still open. [Root.Monarch.GetName] doesn't care too much about religions and our [Root.GovernmentName] follows the Lunarian faith because of convenience with the locals. Hecatia made the offer to entrust her realm in [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s hands if we all convert to Hakurei Shintoism with her as the only deity. Her other idea was to form a strong alliance with us if we just only abandon the Lunarian faith.\nOf course Hecatia would not mind if we continue like we do it before though..."

After all, we played the biggest role in the defeat of the Lunarians. Clownpiece has also become a leader who leads the Earth and Moon fairies, and she thinks that our realm has its own destiny - independently from Hecatia and Junko... even though their is a certain honor to hold with Hecatia.

 ###EVENT FOR ETERNITY GARDEN###
 flavor_lrv.1.t: "The Potential of Eternity Larva"
 flavor_lrv.1.desc: "After our march into the Youkai Forest and the militaristic victory against Hina and the Aki sisters, Eternity Larva took a rest in the Shrine of Harvest. While glaring at the Misty Lake, the three defeated goddesses approached the young fairy. Even though they were former enemies, the Aki sisters nor Hina are goddesses who clings to grudge. Instead they talked with our good mistress and felt something suspicious with her: they claim that Eternity Larva might be indeed more than just a fairy, if not even a goddess, confirming the claim Okina made a long time ago! Eternity can't really believe what they say and continued glancing at the Misty Lake long after they have left her again..."
 flavor_lrv.1.a: "How should I know if they are right?"
 flavor_lrv.2.t: "The Orange Flower"
 flavor_lrv.2.desc: "When Eternity Larva took the flower for herself she had a strange feeling. The flower disintegrated in her hand, but it in a beautiful glimmer. Apparently, it was indeed the very flower Eternity received centuries ago from the humans, worshiping her when she was a goddess and now this flower transferred its power to Eternity!"
 flavor_lrv.2.a: "I'm still worthy!"
 flavor_lrv.3.t: "The Butterflies of Gensokyo"
 flavor_lrv.3.desc: "The cherry blossoms of Netherworld are swirling in the wind when Eternity arrived at the foot of the demon tree Saigyou Ayakashi. Without her noticing, Yuyuko Saigyouji, the mistress of Netherworld, appeared behind Eternity Larva and asked her if Eternity likes the cherry blossoms of this realm. She then noted that she too lost her memory of who she was before she became the ghost lady she is today. When Yuyuko tried to gather the spirit energy for finding out more about her past she of course didn't calculate the threat she posed for Gensokyo and she still feels sorry for it.\nHours have passed and both Yuyuko and Eternity found more parallels like their connection to butterflies. In the end, Yuyuko's daily duties have called for her, but before she vanished she casted a spell on the tree, which transfers some of the remaining spring energy to Eternity Larva, granting her access to the memories she once had as the god Tokoyo no Kami."
 flavor_lrv.3.a: "Thank you, Lady Yuyuko!"
 flavor_lrv.4.t: "The Claims against Kaguya"
 flavor_lrv.4.desc: "Eternity Larva is known for her kindness and friendliness, but when it comes to her entrance she is as elegant and friendly as a fairy can be: marching into the house of a stranger like an elephant visiting the Chinaware store and throwing bunch of claims against Kaguya's head. The princess, completely shocked and puzzled of what was just happening required ten seconds before she was able to react to the claims of Eternity with a loud \"What?!\"...\nAfter a rather painful danmaku fight for Eternity, the situation has relaxed and Kaguya explains to our good mistress, that she has no idea of what the reason could be for Eternity's loss of power. Eternity felt more than bad for what she has done, but Kaguya was in a good mood, so she let Eirin made a potion, which should strengthen Eternity's current powers - even though it doesn't restore her godhood."
 flavor_lrv.4.a: "I am so sorry again, Lady Kaguya!"
 flavor_lrv.5.t: "Rebirth of Tokoyo no Kami!"
 flavor_lrv.5.desc: "Eternity Larva went for the day into her chambers and slept in a cocoon made out of the finest silk our people could find for her. According to her this process is completely unnecessary, but she felt like it fits the most as her appearance in Gensokyo so far was the one of a fairy with butterfly wings. At the next day, Eternity has awakened and broke out of her cocoon. Instead of a fairy who looked like a girl around the age of eight, there was now a fully grown woman with butterfly wings larger than even the already impressive bat wings of the Scarlet Devil.\nAlthough her name is now Tokoyo no Kami, the new goddess still prefers to be called by her fairy name Eternity Larva."
 flavor_lrv.5.a: "I never thought I would grow up this way."
 flavor_lrv.6.t: "Eternal Warriors"
 flavor_lrv.6.desc: "Although Tokoyo no Kami is no goddess of war, she is aware that in times of conflicts people have to arm themselves and have to fight. Because of that, she blessed some of fighters and declared them \"Eternal Warriors\". These soldiers are quite tough in melee combat.\nHowever, even they are not immortal and should they fall these warriors need new recruits - and not everyone is okay with being conscripted and blessed to fight."
 flavor_lrv.6.a: "In times of war everyone needs to do their service."
 flavor_lrv.6.b: "We should limit the recruitment to a minimum."
 flavor_lrv.7.t: "Focus of [Root.GetName]"
 flavor_lrv.7.desc: "Tokoyo no Kami was once a small fairy before she reawakened her abilities as goddess. Before she was able to go through this metamorphosis she had to focus her energies on one aspect of life after another. Our [Root.GovernmentName] should take an example of her and should also focus on our internal and external policies."
 flavor_lrv.7.a: "We should take a focus on the internal policies."
 flavor_lrv.7.b: "The external policies shall be our focus."
 flavor_lrv.7.c: "Both aspects are equally important. We should be more balanced with our focus."
 flavor_lrv.8.t: "Real Estate for real Worship"
 flavor_lrv.8.desc: "Every goddess needs subjects to worship them so they can gain power which they need to protect their subjects in return and Tokoyo no Kami is no exception. However, worshipping a deity needs space as temples must be constructed and people need to be hired to keep said temples intact. Fortunately, our realm has estates, which can take care of this tiresome task."
 flavor_lrv.8.a: "Is only natural that the Shrine Maidens should take care of it."
 flavor_lrv.8.b: "The Burghers should see more of Tokoyo no Kami's grace."
 flavor_lrv.8.c: "Our Youkai could take care of the shrines."
 flavor_lrv.8.d: "It is better if the Crown handles the temples itself."
 flavor_lrv.9.t: "Tribute to Tokoyo no Kami"
 flavor_lrv.9.desc: "Our beloved goddess Tokoyo no Kami is a relatively young one compared to the others in Gensokyo. As such she still has to grow in power. Fortunately, our realm can contribute to her growth by paying her tribute in form of special trade goods we have not monopolized yet. In exchange, Tokoyo no Kami will grant us her blessing! It is up to us though what trade good we will pay to her."

 flavor_lrv.10.t: "The Mental Fight with Okina Matara"
 flavor_lrv.10.desc: "The utter destruction of the Land of the Back Doors was the first step to claim Okina's power. The next one requires the defeat of the Goddess through the hands of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. However, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is only a fairy and as such would be obliterated in a fair danmaku fight against Okina. It would require a lot of absurd power to face her and only the lack of self preservation would allow to have full access to this power - something, which only Cirno manages to do.\nFortunately, there is a different way to defeat a goddess, which is by defeating her in a Test of Endurance. Basically, [Root.Monarch.GetName] bets that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will endure all of Okina's tricks, manipulations and what not and will succumb to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] arch rival. Should [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] win Okina will be humiliated and will be forced to transfer parts of her power to [Root.Monarch.GetName]."

 flavor_lrv.13.t: "Victory over Okina!"
 flavor_lrv.13.desc: "Despite Okina's best efforts, in the end she didn't manage to break our good ruler's iron will! In a Test of Endurance, it was [Root.Monarch.GetName] who overcame all of Okina's challenges and didn't fall for her tricks. Now it is time for Okina to transfer her power to [Root.Monarch.GetName] and to retire as sage of Gensokyo!"

 flavor_lrv.13.a.tt: "The Test of Endurance is over and [Root.Monarch.GetName] has passed it!"

 flavor_lrv.14.desc: "Although [Root.Monarch.GetName] has given [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] best, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] succumbed to Okina's schemes and power in the end anyway. Of course Okina takes this to her fullest advantage and builds her own power within our realm! It will take time to purge the influence of this evil deity in our land, but until then our country has to endure her."
 flavor_lrv.14.a: "This was not the last time you have heard of me, Okina!"

However, Okina wants to change it and makes an offer: she will manipulate the Life Energy of the wounded fairy soldiers and let them return to our ranks.

 flavor_sff.1.desc: "The Sunflower Fields is one of the older countries in Gensokyo. Our nation saw the first rise of the Hakurei Religion and the incidents of the past. However, like flowers, religions grow and become more and as such we follow the reformed Hakurei Shintoism. However, many people are still stuck in the past and try to undermine the state's religion by staying with the Hakurei Traditions. How should our realm react to this stubbornness?"
 flavor_sff.1.a: "Forcefully mass converting is just a game. A fun one."
 flavor_sff.1.b: "Why should I care which religion my subjects follow?"
 flavor_sff.1.c: "You know, those were better times..."
 flavor_sff.2.t: "Fight with the Goddess"

The gates of the capital opened and a white-haired woman with three pairs of wings appeared. It is none other than Shinki herself, the goddess of Makai and the creator of the devils and demons of Makai. She advanced through our bombard and called out the name of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Her suggestion was that the two rulers, as before, would fight a danmaku fight like in old times and if she won, we should quit the war efforts immediately. It's anachronistic, but on the contrary, if it ends in [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s victory, we may be able to confirm our victory and make her a bigger demand than we had ever planned..."

 flavor_sff.3.t: "Suspicious Gap Youkai"
 flavor_sff.3.desc: "So, are you playing on her instead of me this time? Well, that's fine because to go here and there for helping you every time is too tiring anyway. Since we've come all the way here, would you like a gift? Oh, but I can't just give it to you. Where would be the challenge in that? No, you should fight for your gift. I want to have a proper danmaku fight – and the youkai you're now is perfect for that challenge. If you beat me, I'll give you your present, how about that?"

Then we give you your promised gift, shall we? I can hand this purple blob you people call country over to you here if you want. How does it sound like?"
 flavor_sff.31.a: "Ehm… thank you?"
 flavor_sff.31.a.tt: "You're welcome. Oh, a small side note: my subjects aren't used to sudden changes. So you have to resolve that out by yourself. Then I'll go back to sleep.\n"
 flavor_sff.31.b: "Even for a youkai of Gensokyo, you're acting weird. Keep your 'blob'."

It is also said that the area they call the 'Belly Button of the World' is the most prosperous city around it, and its owner is the most powerful force in the region. Their role in conquering this area will be important..."
 flavor_sff.8.a: "It's better rule through the natives who already exist."

Of course, she also wants to expand our realm beyond the scope of the garden if she has the opportunity and the potential, but that is a more of an optional goal. Her immediate goal is to make the current garden more beautiful. The rest, the area outside the garden, is just a place where she collects new flowers of and destroys enemies of nature as well as sources for quality fertilizers."

One special human drew Yuuka's full attention, who was nobody else than Yoshimasa Ashikaga, the shogun of Japan. He was a very cultured man who was bound by a shogun's duty he was not too happy with. Yoshimasa explained Yuuka the many secrets of not only Ikebana but also his others passions like tea ceremonies and architecture.\nIn the end of Yuuka's visit, the shogun gave her his favorite flowers."

The Onin War as well as the many years have shown their signs on him and he was believed to be dead, but this old man still was very much alive when Yuuka found him. Yoshimasa explained Yuuka the many secrets of not only Ikebana but also his others passions like tea ceremonies and architecture.\nIn the end of Yuuka's visit, the old artist wished to follow Yuuka to Gensokyo because the many conflicts in connection to his family and the shogunate are too much for him.

The tributes, which the souls carry with them, are the main source of power. In a way, the shinigami are responsible for the economical growth of [Root.GetName].\nHowever, their leader, Komachi Onozuka, has a tendency to slack off with her job. A lot. While she is a kind hearted individual, her behavior is irresponsible. Komachi managed to gain privileges from Hecatia, which allowed the shinigami to be as lazy as they desire.

They fought countless battles for a religious war they never won.\nIn the end, however, all these great religious figures have lost their followership and their political power.

Fortunately for both sides, Satori has decided to negotiate with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]: the war shall end from this day forward, and Chireiden will recognize the Yama Authority as their liege.

They designed the laws and rules which are the benchmarks for judging the souls.\nIn recent time the Ministry has shown financial problems left and right. Eventually, the 10 Kings - the rulers of the Ministry - pawned Higan and their other territories in Gensokyo to Hecatia.

While his sister Yami represented life, the good king Yama represented death and, after his own death, justice as he became the very first of those who judge the deceased.\n\nThrough the influence of the Hindustic faith, Buddhism picked the deity of the Yama up for its own belief system, which then later evolved in China and Japan to the yama we know today.

For the untrained eye, this woman might look like any other in Gensokyo - and this is what our mistress intended. Through a long process of surgical precision and magical power, Lady Mima has created the perfect host for her desire.\nWhile there are other steps necessary for the possession, the vengeful spirit is more than content with our work!"
 flavor_mim.10.a: "One step closer to my resurrection!"
 flavor_mim.11.t: "Faith in the Spirit"
 flavor_mim.11.desc: "\"Mima will return! Mima will return!\" This prediction has become a running slogan for the [Root.Religion.GetName] people. The heretics laugh at their hope for our mistress official return. What they don't know is that their yells generates faith for Mima, which is needed for her merge with the lifeless body. The faith power also has another effect: it strengthens the magical abilities of our mistress significantly, allowing her to specialize her powers even further!"
 flavor_mim.11.a: "I am getting stronger!"
 flavor_mim.12.t: "Mima has returned!"
 flavor_mim.12.desc: "Ever since the great schism of the Hakurei faith, the vengeful spirit Mima has withdrawn from the public eyes. For the most part, the south of Gensokyo has forgotten Mima's existence, and was mostly busy with their own issues.\nBut now they have to react as the evil once-spirit has now returned, more powerful and influential than ever before.

She claims that a great part of her knowledge is from Satori, the mistress of Chireiden, when she tried to possess her.

 flavor_mim.14.t: "The Master of Gensokyo"
 flavor_mim.14.desc: "A long time ago, our great realm was nothing more than a collection of sealed spirits from Hokora. Eventually, one of us gathered enough strength to break free. This very person was our mistress Mima, who caused enough troubles to Reimu to indirectly cause the schism.\nJust like how our mistress broke free from her seal to unleash her might on the Hakurei Shrine, so did we expand beyond the boundaries of the World of Fantasies in order to become the new masters of Gensokyo."

 flavor_mim.15.desc: "The sunflowers of the Sunflower Field appear to be harmless. But as soon a fool starts collecting their seeds, they will notice that these flowers are anything but harmless. They are the source of Yuuka's power, and in order to maintain and grow their power, the great youkai has imbued lost souls to the seed and channeled highly unstable magic into them.\nIt's a mystery to us how Yuuka even manages to keep these flowers alive without blowing up half of Gensokyo, and our mistress Mima even noted that it is in our interest to not touch anymore seeds than necessary for her goals. Fortunately, we already picked a little bit more than needed, so the remaining ones can be used for a powerful spell."

 flavor_mim.16.desc: "The Hourai Elixir is the pinnacle of master alchemy, and its ingredients are hard to come by. Mima knows the full list out of memory, but neither us nor our mistress are interested in such quest. Such lowly matters are a task for ordinary magicians.\nNo, our mistress has a better way to get the ingredients for a new potion. Through a complicated multi-step ritual, Mima manages to extract a portion of the Hourai Elixir out of the two captured immortals. This extract will be the base for the potion, which shall grant eternal life!\nBut first, the extraction must occur..."

The Moon has fallen, and is now proper of [Root.GetName], though many of the elite guard still try to cling to their dying state. What they don't know is that the power of the spirits is accelerated on the moon - powerful enough to even possess the bodies of the Lunarian Elite Forces, and turn them against their fellow kind!"

But that beacon started to fail. [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s commands became more and more suicidal, and paranoia raised within our own ranks! It went so bad that lunarians raised their weapons against their own kin!\nAt this moment it was clear what happened: the vengeful spirit Mima sent her underlings, and used them to possess [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"

 flavor_mim.24.t: "Vengeance on Rika"
 flavor_mim.24.desc: "The current resurrection attempt of our mistress Mima is not the first one. Quite some time ago, she tried a resurrection ritual in the past. Although it was not as developed as the current ritual, it still showed promising results. Unfortunately, a rain of artillery shells interrupted the ritual, and the resurrection of our mistress got cancelled.\nThe culprit behind all of that was Rika, and now her land is ours. Apparently, Rika did not intend to interrupt the ritual, and as such our mistress made a deal: Rika gives three of her best cannons in exchange of us \"forgetting\" the incident."

 flavor_kpp.3.desc: "The kappa of Gensokyo were always a peaceful people, trying to create new inventions and earn some money on the markets of the Human Capital.

 flavor_kpp.7.t: "Fly! Sanpai Fight"
 flavor_kpp.7.desc: "\"Fly! Sanpai Fight\" - the newest breakthrough in kappa technology. Although its name raised many eyebrows of veteran kappa engineers, the idea undoubtedly convinced even the most conservative tinkerer. Through the usage of the advanced technology of the space ship, the brilliant minds of our [Root.GovernmentName] designed a jetpack for the usual kappa, which allows them to move over difficult terrain with relative ease. No longer has any kappa have to walk into the battlefield on foot - and best the best thing about them is their reliability! Even under heavy fire, the Fly!

 flavor_tgu.4.desc: "With the conquest of the Human Capital a formidable number of new subjects joined [Root.GetName] - subjects which are prone to rebellion if they do not receive the tengu truth. Because of this new news offices opened in all of our country which have no but one purpose: to deliver the propaganda needed to pacify the masses.

Though they are historically not the highest in the social hierarchy, it is undoubted that their service is invaluable for the security of [Root.GetName].\nOne of its greatest is Momiji Inubashiri whose military experiences and expertise brought many victories to the state.

 flavor_tgu.7.t: "Hatate Himekaidou's New Place"
 flavor_tgu.7.desc: "The caste system of [Root.GetName] is based on birth. A crow tengu is and will always be a crow tengu, working as a journalist. A wolf tengu is fated to be a soldier for [Root.GetName] and a great tengu is gifted with the privilege to rule.\nWithin these castes there is another level of hierarchy, which is determined by Prince Shotouku's merit system where the position of the individual is visible by their colors.\nHatate Himekaidou is one of the most gifted, competent and cunning of the crow tengu and earned her purple color through merit. Though her heart is with her fellow crow tengu, she earned herself a position which is equal of that of a great tengu. Through concessions to her kind, Hatate finally agreed to serve the court and [Root.Monarch.GetName] as their most trusted advisor."

 flavor_tgu.8.t: "Codification of the Caste System"
 flavor_tgu.8.desc: "The caste system of [Root.GetName] existed for generations. The Great Tengu delegate and rule over the country while the Low Tengu do the manual and spiritual work. Directed is the whole process by the great chief Tenma who regularly sends demands to the representative of the Low Tengu.\nThough this system prevailed for many centuries, it was never one which was legally codified by all the castes other than the Great Tengu one. This changes today as [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the other leaders the Low Tengu castes finally agree on the codification of the Caste System in exchange of drastically lowering the demands of Tenma."

 flavor_tgu.9.t: "Fate of the Lower Tengu"
 flavor_tgu.9.desc: "The Tengu Civil War caused a great rift in the relationship between the Low and the Great Tengu.

 flavor_tgu.10.desc: "Our new republic is still in the process of recovering from the civil war. One of its many actions to do so is ensuring that the former war enemies will no longer pose a threat to the country.\nMegumu Iizunamaru, the leader and former general of the Great Tengu, is one of these threats if left unchecked. The Great Tengu are more than loyal to her and her ambitions are unknown to our state. Fortunately for us, Megumu herself is only interested in maintaining her own power - regardless who she has to serve under. She found herself now a position in our new court where she serves as the mouthpiece of the Great Tengu while also enjoying a quality of life standard she could never have without the republic."

This changed drastically, however, when the Moriya Clan arrived and brought with them their heretic views to Gensokyo. The Moriya Shinto faith established spread first to the kappa and later found its way into tengu minds - though not without force by Kananko and her minions.\nTensions between [Root.GetName] and [MRY.GetName] have been growing over the last few months though and our people are now questioning our official state religion. Maybe the time has come to turn our back on the Moriya way of faith..."

Through the diplomatic pressure of Gensokyo and the uncertainty of the future, [MRY.GetName] has decided to return to a more hostile approach to the [MRY.GetAdjective]-[Root.GetAdjective] diplomacy.\nWhile we would be able to defeat them in combat, we would open our gates for hostile invaders during a hypothetical war with [MRY.GetName].

Our princesses, Watatsuki sisters, have a different opinions regarding this. Yorihime wants to restore a royal guard, which will consist of finest troops, with a best equipment possible. This will drastically improve our troops efficiently, but will also increase their cost. Toyohime, on the other hand, wants to increase the number of our troops, by creating new training bases, and increasing the prestige of our army in the eyes of the general population, which will force them to join it."

After years of exile, we have decided to forgive Kaguya, and return her back to the moon. However, she betrayed our kindness, and escaped to Gensokyo, taking our genius, Eirin, with her. Now that we control Eientei, we could provide a punishment for Kaguya, Eirin and Reisen, however, that wouldn't be rational. Instead, we should use their knowledge and minds, to ensure the prosperity of the Lunarians in these dark times. And... what about this mansion, filled with Earth Rabbits?

The non-possessors claim that the Shrines are being corrupted by this great wealth. Their opponents argue that the Shrines need this wealth to carry out its holy mission. The key thing is the Shrines aren't really a big taxpayer, if they were forced to give their land away it would move it into the hands of people we can tax. The downside would be the Shrines would have less wealth to perform their mission."

 th_th_oldhakurei_events.2.d: "The Shrines have gathered in a great Meeting, they are asking for your support and certain privileges in return for helping exterminating wild youkai that are stalking our land. Do we help the Shrines keep our people safe or should we support those independent Youkai Hunters."
 th_th_oldhakurei_events.2.a: "Support the Shrines."
 th_th_oldhakurei_events.2.b: "We need independent Youkai Hunters."
 th_th_oldhakurei_events.3.t: "Religious Reform"
 th_th_oldhakurei_events.3.d: "The Hakurei Tradition was the first major religion of Gensokyo and the only true Shintoistic Faith - and as such its pious members act in the Tradition's best interests. However, our family is large and diverse. Our influential Shrine Maidens are proposing some reforms to our 'stale' traditions that will bring our form closer to the other faiths in Gensokyo. The idea is bold and will strengthen the Shrines but we know that the superstitious and backward will reject this change."
 th_th_oldhakurei_events.3.a: "Support the Reform."
 th_th_oldhakurei_events.3.b: "Hold true to the old ways."
 th_th_oldhakurei_events.4.t: "Reduce the Independence of the Shrines"
 th_th_oldhakurei_events.4.d: "The Shrines are a powerful institution, but more important a wealthy one. If we were to rein in the Shrines and make them pay more to the state, we would also bring in more income. On the other hand we would also sap their authority in the eyes of the masses."
 th_th_oldhakurei_events.4.a: "Reign them in."
 th_th_oldhakurei_events.4.b: "Protect their independence."
 th_th_oldhakurei_events.5.t: "State appointed Lay Members?"
 th_th_oldhakurei_events.5.d: "If we were to promote and strengthen the powers of lay members of the Shrines administration and bring in more state appointments, we would bring the Shrines under central control. The other side of the coin is that we will damage the Shrines' moral standing with the people."
 th_th_oldhakurei_events.5.a: "Appoint them."
 th_th_oldhakurei_events.5.b: "Let the Sacred Shrines be."

 touhou_schools_events.1.desc: "As a young country, we are not yet patronizing any particular religious school. While there are many ways to follow the deities we should have a specific guiding doctrine for our rulers to follow as well as a certain deity we will worship over the others."

 ###HARMONIZATION EVENTS###
 th_confucian_events.1.t: "Harmonization of Gensokyan Faiths"
 th_confucian_events.1.d: "The Gensokyan religion group has its origins in ancient Shintoism of the Japanese. Over time it evolved into its own religion and took some aspects of Buddhism and even Taoism, incorporating both to an unique philosophy of life. In many ways this has in turn made their religion easier to incorporate and harmonize with the ideology of [Root.GetName]. As time goes by the Gensokyan identity becomes less and less of an issue and Gensokyan followers can be found high and low in [Root.GetAdjective] society, forming a new group within our complex government apparatus that an outsider would have a very hard time distinguishing from our own."
 th_confucian_events.1.a: "'Submit the people of virtue, assimilate the people with enlightenment.'"
 th_confucian_events.2.t: "Harmonization of Hakurei Shintoism"
 th_confucian_events.2.d: "Hakurei Shintoism is Gensokyo's oldest and most prominent religion and has its origins in ancient Shintoism of the Japanese. Over time it evolved into its own religion and took some aspects of Buddhism and even Taoism, incorporating both to an unique philosophy of life. As time goes by, the Hakurei Shintoistic identity becomes less and less of an issue and Hakurei followers can be found high and low in [Root.GetAdjective] society, forming a new group within our complex government apparatus that an outsider would have a very hard time distinguishing from our own."
 th_confucian_events.2.a: "'Submit the people of virtue, assimilate the people with enlightenment.'"
 th_confucian_events.3.t: "Harmonization of Moriya Shintoism"
 th_confucian_events.3.d: "Moriya Shintoism is - in contrast to the other Gensokyan religions - relatively new. It was designed as a reformation of Hakurei Shintoism, but it still consists of many parts of Taoism, Buddhism and Japanese Shintoism. As time goes by the Moriya Shintoistic identity becomes less and less of an issue and Moriya followers can be found high and low in [Root.GetAdjective] society, forming a new group within our complex government apparatus that an outsider would have a very hard time distinguishing from our own."
 th_confucian_events.3.a: "'Submit the people of virtue, assimilate the people with enlightenment.'"
 th_confucian_events.4.t: "Harmonization of Gensokyan Taoism"
 th_confucian_events.4.d: "Taoism is originally a Chinese religion with many parallel to today's Confucian. While it drifted away from its Chinese original, it still contains many teachings of the old philosophy of life, which in turn are essential parts of our religion. In many ways this has in turn made their religion easier to incorporate and harmonize with the ideology of [Root.GetName]. As time goes by the Taoistic identity becomes less and less of an issue and Taoistic followers can be found high and low in [Root.GetAdjective] society, forming a new group within our complex government apparatus that an outsider would have a very hard time distinguishing from our own."
 th_confucian_events.4.a: "'Submit the people of virtue, assimilate the people with enlightenment.'"
 th_confucian_events.5.t: "Harmonization of Eastern Faiths"
 th_confucian_events.5.d: "The Eastern religion group is ancient and possesses many roots of our religion today, which makes the harmonization of these religions relatively easy. At first the Buddhistic, the Shintoistic and the Confucian didn't accept our new view of religion and philosophy, but as time went by they became more and more integrated in our society. But even our religion adapted to the old ways and integrated the view of gods and karma and Confucianism teachings."
 th_confucian_events.5.a: "'Submit the people of virtue, assimilate the people with enlightenment.'"
 th_confucian_events.6.t: "Harmonization of Hakurei Traditions"
 th_confucian_events.6.d: "The old Hakurei Tradition was once the common Hakurei Shintoism in Gensokyo. It shares many similarities with his reformed successor but it was still missing the Spell Card System, which has been a huge part of modern day Gensokyo. Either way, the many followers of this religion have found their place within our nation and adapted to the new Spell Card System while maintaining their icons of the past.  As time goes by the old Hakurei Tradition identity becomes less and less of an issue and Traditional followers can be found high and low in [Root.GetAdjective] society, forming a new group within our complex government apparatus that an outsider would have a very hard time distinguishing from our own."
 th_confucian_events.6.a: "'Submit the people of virtue, assimilate the people with enlightenment.'"
 th_confucian_events.7.t: "Harmonization of Shinkism"
 th_confucian_events.7.d: "Shinkism is viewed by the most Gensokyan as a cult - a heresy, which only allows to worship Shinki, the creator of Makai. Even though Shinkism has abandoned the worship of the other gods of Gensokyo, their principles still are the ones of the Hakurei Traditions, which made their integration in our realm quite easy as the many basics of Buddhism and Shintoism are still found. As time goes by the Shinkistic identity becomes less and less of an issue and Shinkistic followers can be found high and low in [Root.GetAdjective] society, forming a new group within our complex government apparatus that an outsider would have a very hard time distinguishing from our own."
 th_confucian_events.7.a: "'Submit the people of virtue, assimilate the people with enlightenment.'"
 th_confucian_events.8.t: "Harmonization of Touhou Christian"
 th_confucian_events.8.d: "Touhou Christianity is unlike any other religion in Gensokyo. According to Gensokyo's inhabitants, Touhou Christianity has its origin in the far west in the Outworld. Fortunately, the strong influence of Gensokyo forced the Touhou Christians to adopt many Shintoistic teachings.  As time goes by the Touhou Christian identity becomes less and less of an issue and Christian followers can be found high and low in [Root.GetAdjective] society, forming a new group within our complex government apparatus that an outsider would have a very hard time distinguishing from our own."
 th_confucian_events.8.a: "'Submit the people of virtue, assimilate the people with enlightenment.'"
 th_confucian_events.9.t: "Harmonization of Lunarism"
 th_confucian_events.9.d: "Lunarism is the folk religion of the inhabitants of the Moon and is deep rooted in their culture. The Lunarians are troublesome people, whose national, cultural and religious pride makes it hard to deal with in every aspect. So it wasn't a big surprise the integration of their belief was a costly undertake, but in the end the ideas of tolerance found its way in the Lunarian mindsets."
 th_confucian_events.9.a: "'Submit the people of virtue, assimilate the people with enlightenment.'"
 ###Touhou Buddhist EVENTS###
 th_buddhism_events.1.t: "Minister Resigns"
 th_buddhism_events.1.d: "$PHILOSOPHER$$NATURAL_SCIENTIST$$ARTIST$$TREASURER$$THEOLOGIAN$$MASTER_OF_MINT$$INQUISITOR$ has publicly condemned the policies of [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] government. Our Minister will no longer have anything to do with us and reminds us that a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] that cannot uphold the rightful laws will attract nothing but liars and informers to [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] government."
 th_buddhism_events.1.a: "Good Riddance!"
 th_buddhism_events.2.t: "[Root.GetName] Monasteries deteriorating"
 th_buddhism_events.2.d: "Due to a combination of lacking monastic discipline and a faltering economy, many of the great monasteries of [Root.GetName] have seen their membership dwindling over the last few years. A concerned Bhikkhu has approached the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] with a warning that unless something is done soon the dire situation may lead to the last few monks abandoning their vows or seeking to join monasteries elsewhere, leaving [Root.GetName] impoverished both spiritually and economically. There are, however, many local landowners more than ready to infringe on the land an empty monastery would leave behind. As the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] is meant to protect Monastic life in [Root.Owner.GetName] it will be clear to many observers that the responsibility for whatever happens will rest on [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] shoulders."
 th_buddhism_events.2.a: "We must do all we can!"
 th_buddhism_events.2.b: "Perhaps now the land will come to better use."
 th_buddhism_events.3.t: "Monastic Orders Support Pretender"
 th_buddhism_events.3.d: "As it is the monarch's duty to protect the monastic institutions it is those institutions' duty to protect the country against bad rulers. Due to what they feel is lacking attentiveness to the duties of a monarch and inability and disinterest in upholding and protecting the common good in general and the monastic organizations of our country in particular some of the more powerful monasteries have openly come out in support of a distant relative to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 th_buddhism_events.3.a: "This is an outrage!"
 th_buddhism_events.4.t: "Shou's Fury"
 th_buddhism_events.4.d: "While Buddhism of Gensokyo focuses on a life of tolerance and harmony not everyone is able to follow the teachings of Byakuren Hijiri constantly. Shou, the Avatar of Bishamonten is a disciple of Byakuren, but unlike any other disciple she is also mentor of Byakuren. However, both influential persons have two very different views regarding armed conflicts: while the teachings of Byakuren Hijiri forbids to let fury and anger guide us through the time of war, Shou flows in rage and fury to defend her homeland. Now the question remains: which philosophy should we adapt to in these rough times?"
 th_buddhism_events.4.a: "Shou's Fury will guide us to victory!"
 th_buddhism_events.4.b: "We cannot allow rage to blind us."
 th_buddhism_events.9.t: "The Horrors of War"
 th_buddhism_events.9.d: "Not all men are cut out to lead a life of war and it seems the conflict our country is currently in has made some of them realize it. The number of deserters seeking to hide behind the walls of the monasteries is not big but they set a dangerous example. As a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] it is, however, our duty to protect the monasteries and while we have repeatedly warned them not to accept men like these, it seems some still do."
 th_buddhism_events.9.a: "We must remember to be gentle."
 th_buddhism_events.9.b: "Demand that the monasteries release these 'monks' to us."
 th_buddhism_events.9.c: "Fine the monasteries for any deserter found."
 th_buddhism_events.11.t: "Idol Trend"
 th_buddhism_events.11.d: "There has been lately a trend, where many Buddhistic people buy themselves idols, which are supposed to bring luck and a step closer to Nirvana. Of course this is complete nonsense, but our local merchants and producers are very happy with this trend as it brings them and us a fortune. However, allowing them to continue to produce and sell those idols our people may move more and more away from the right path."
 th_buddhism_events.11.a: "We have to stop this!"
 th_buddhism_events.11.b: "Money is holier than enlightenment."
 th_buddhism_events.12.t: "Volunteers for the Army"
 th_buddhism_events.12.d: "Many young youkai, humans and fairies reported for duty at our recruiters. Though our man pool is dwindling, those new recruits are really young - some even still go to a school! We could use those recruits quite well, but on the other hand it is more ethical to send those young men and women back to their families."
 th_buddhism_events.12.a: "Send them back to their mothers and fathers."
 th_buddhism_events.12.b: "We don't have the luxury of being ethical."
 th_buddhism_events.13.t: "Popular Novel"
 th_buddhism_events.13.d: "A vernacular novel about a well-known story from the [Root.GetOldEra] era is rapidly gaining popularity among our subjects. This in itself is not a problem but it has come to our attention that this novelization is in fact breaking central tenets of Gensokyan-Buddhistic ideology as it could be seen as an argument for causing more conflicts between the humans and youkai.\nOur administrators now argue that the book must be banned, though some fear this will only make it more alluring to those that wish to read it."
 th_buddhism_events.13.a: "It must be banned immediately."
 th_buddhism_events.13.b: "We lead by example not decree. Let it be."
 th_buddhism_events.14.t: "Civil Service"
 th_buddhism_events.14.d: "Education, self-improvement and adherence to the classics are the backbone of Gensokyan-Buddhistic government and if our [Root.GovernmentName] is to aspire to greatness we must at all times devote money, attention and energy to ensuring that our officials are as well educated and well informed as they can possibly be. It is therefore of some concern that the number of people seeking government employment seem to be decreasing as of late."
 th_buddhism_events.14.a: "We must expand the bureaucracy!"
 th_buddhism_events.14.b: "There is no need to reinforce the cadres just yet."
 th_buddhism_events.15.t: "Dana"
 th_buddhism_events.15.d: "It is at times such as these, when our country is characterized by relative tranquility that we are reminded to look at those who are less fortunate. The recent crop yields have been neither failures nor a great success and as a result most have food and the state has ample grain supplies. There are, however, still some unfortunate who haven't got enough food to feed themselves."
 th_buddhism_events.15.a: "Let us distribute our grain to the poor!"
 th_buddhism_events.15.b: "Keep it in reserve."
 th_buddhism_events.16.t: "Vicious Words?"
 th_buddhism_events.16.d: "The local aristocracy in [Root.GetName] seems to have been growing quite powerful over the last few years. While we retain nominal control over the area much of the real power lies with the local landowners who have been known to grow their domains at the expense of monastery land. This practice, along with other excesses may well be used against them but in order to achieve the full effect we would probably need to embellish the truth a little. There are those who would be willing to do just that for us in exchange for nice positions in our administration afterwards."
 th_buddhism_events.16.a: "Let us find another way."
 th_buddhism_events.16.b: "The end justifies the means."
 th_buddhism_events.22.t: "Plight of [Root.GetName]"
 th_buddhism_events.22.d: "A representative of the farmers of [Root.GetName] arrived in [Root.Owner.Capital.GetCapitalName] today, imploring [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] to help expand and maintain the irrigation system of the province. The local population is growing and claiming new land at a speed that the current infrastructure does not support. The representative also asks that the state supply food to those who need it in the meantime.\nWhile this project would have few downsides besides the cost, there are currently no plans to improve this particular region and doing so in a reasonable time would likely be quite expensive."
 th_buddhism_events.22.a: "This [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] is always ready to listen to the people."
 th_buddhism_events.22.b: "You will have to wait for your turn."
 th_buddhism_events.23.t: "Inheritance"
 th_buddhism_events.23.d: "A conflict has arisen in one of the more influential monasteries of [Root.GetName] after the death of a monk. The monk in question came from a very influential lay family and during his time in robes, he had managed to acquire a rich set of valuable manuscripts and an assortment of Buddha images and other things. While monks cannot own property, the law still allows for a dedicated disciple to inherit these things and be considered as a son to the monk. In this case a young disciple has taken care of the monk as he lay at his end. There are, however, others interested, the monastery itself has argued that they should get the inheritance and would likely be very thankful for support in this matter. The lay family of the monk have also approached [Root.Monarch.GetName] hoping to inherit not only the manuscripts and images but also some of the land they have donated to the monastery while their family member was part of it."
 th_buddhism_events.23.a: "Rule in favor of the disciple."
 th_buddhism_events.23.b: "Rule in favor of the Monastery."
 th_buddhism_events.23.c: "Support the lay family of the monk."
 th_buddhism_events.29.t: "Foreign Emissary Insults [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 th_buddhism_events.29.d: "The emissary of one of our neighboring countries has given grave affront to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] by refusing to participate in a ceremony he was invited to attend. [Root.Monarch.GetName] is furious and while there can be some doubt as to if the slight was deliberate or not the public clearly sees it as such.\nIf we do not publicly condemn the ambassador we risk losing face, the council of ministers, however, urge caution."
 th_buddhism_events.29.a: "Publicly deride the ambassador."
 th_buddhism_events.29.b: "A ruler must never lose [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] temper."
 th_buddhism_events.30.t: "The [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] accused of favoritism"
 th_buddhism_events.30.d: "It is with great pleasure that [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] has watched some of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] close friends climb the state hierarchy but now this has made us the target of accusations of favoritism. The local governor of [Root.GetName] has been singled out by these accusations and the situation would undoubtedly be defused by replacing him no matter how competent he has been on that post."
 th_buddhism_events.30.a: "His services are required by the state."
 th_buddhism_events.30.b: "We must avoid favoritism at all cost."
 th_bdh_meditation_events.1.t: "Path to Enlightenment"
 th_bdh_meditation_events.1.desc: "Buddhism has the concept of repeated rebirth caused by bindings to the material world. To break the cycle of repeated rebirth and to reach Nirvana, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has to let go all of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] bounds and worries and achieve an inner peace - achieved through a lot of meditation."
 th_bdh_meditation_events.1.a: "It is time for me to meditate about this."
 th_bdh_meditation_events.1.a.tt: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] will meditate now, which will decrease [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] positions as ruler, but allows [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to gain new understanding of the universe and eventual inner peace."
 th_bdh_meditation_events.1.b: "I don't have the time for this now."
 th_bdh_meditation_events.1.b.tt: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] will use [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] time for [Root.GetName] instead. The option to meditate will however be available as a decision."
 th_bdh_longer_meditating: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] will meditate longer and more carefully about the deeper meanings of life.\n\nThere is a chance that our nation will get more powerful rewards."
 th_bdh_longer_cancel_meditation: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] will stop with the meditation and will use [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] new found knowledge in [Root.GetName]'s benefit."
 th_bdh_meditation_events.2.t: "New Understandings"
 th_bdh_meditation_events.2.desc: "Due to time of meditation and reflecting the meanings of the universe, [Root.Monarch.GetName] gained new understandings of the world."
 th_bdh_meditation_events.2.m: "I should reflect longer about those topics."
 th_bdh_meditation_events.2.a: "I will use this knowledge for a better life management."
 th_bdh_meditation_events.2.b: "I will use this knowledge for peace."
 th_bdh_meditation_events.2.c: "I will use this knowledge for defense."
 th_bdh_meditation_events.2.d: "I will use this knowledge against my enemies."
 th_bdh_meditation_events.2.e: "I will use this knowledge for my people."
 th_bdh_meditation_events.2.f: "I will use this knowledge to bring the world together."
 th_bdh_meditation_events.3.t: "Distractions during Meditation"
 th_bdh_meditation_events.3.desc: "Meditation is an activity of harmony, where one just focuses on the world and the inner being. For this Buddhists look for a place, where they are left alone and in peace. This is, however, not always possible - especially in Gensokyo, where every fairy feels to be obligated to annoy our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\nStill, [Root.Monarch.GetName] managed to gain more wisdom, despite the fairies trying their best to sabotage [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] unintentionally."
 th_bdh_meditation_events.4.t: "Successful Reflections on Enlightenment"
 th_bdh_meditation_events.4.desc: "The Path to Enlightenment is paved with the worldly obstacles. But fortunately, [Root.Monarch.GetName] seems to overcome those just fine and even made some new wisdoms regarding the world and the lives in Gensokyo."
 th_bdh_meditation_events.5.t: "Very Successful Meditation"
 th_bdh_meditation_events.5.desc: "It seems like the stars themselves are aligning while [Root.Monarch.GetName] is studying the concepts of the world, the universe and the inner being. The understandings our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] gained are phenomenal."
 th_bdh_meditation_events.6.t: "Paradox!"
 th_bdh_meditation_events.6.desc: "Even though [Root.Monarch.GetName] is a pious [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan], [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is not invulnerable to errors. As our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was reflecting on Nirvana, immortality and reincarnation, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] fell into a paradox example, where all those three aspects stood in conflict to each other.\nLuckily, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was able to solve this, but this error threw [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] completely off and the only knowledge, which was able to gained, was the one from the beginning of the meditation."
 th_bdh_meditation_events.7.t: "Understandings of Karma"
 th_bdh_meditation_events.7.desc: "Karma is a spiritual concept of the principle of reactions following actions. It is a complex topic where every branch of Buddhism is considered and how they all view Karma differently. While [Root.Monarch.GetName] was meditating about this, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] worked out the idea of Karma in the Touhou-Buddhistic faith and added it to the rules of Buddhism in Gensokyo."
 th_bdh_meditation_events.8.t: "Youkai and the Nirvana"
 th_bdh_meditation_events.8.desc: "Touhou Buddhist has its root in Japan's Buddhism, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] never thought about its deeper connection with its roots, Vajrayana Buddhism. While both have the system of Karma, the Gensokyan version is a lot more adapted to Gensokyo and their youkai. Of course, this throws the question of whether youkai are the actual state of Nirvana.\nA scandalous thought, as youkai are, of course, living beings in the world, and therefore are most likely reincarnations, but on the other hand they possess abilities and the state of immortality that no human can reach... [Root.Monarch.GetName] decided to stop with this thought as it was too much in the contrary to the Buddhistic teachings."
 th_bdh_meditation_events.9.t: "Connection between Spirit, Soul and Body" 
 th_bdh_meditation_events.9.desc: "What are spirit, soul and body? What makes them work in harmony and which one of them allows the use of magic? Those are no questions regarding Buddhism but questions in general, which kept [Root.Monarch.GetName] thinking a lot lately and although [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] didn't get a final answer to those questions, they brought [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] an insight into many aspects of life ... and hygiene for soul and mind."
 th_bdh_meditation_events.10.t: "Discovery of the Meaning of Life"
 th_bdh_meditation_events.10.desc: "Ever since humans wandered on this world they asked themselves what is the meaning of life. And although this may not appear as such the question of their own existence is something the youkai and gods of Gensokyo affect. Many people of different ages, backgrounds and social positions brought different answers, but none of them were valid for the people of [Root.GetName].\n[Root.Monarch.GetName], however, found the answer for this question! - or at least [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] believes [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] did. Only after more meditation can truly [Root.Monarch.GetName] confirm the answer."
 th_bdh_meditation_events.11.t: "Enlightenment!"
 th_bdh_meditation_events.11.desc: "It was a calm day and [Root.Monarch.GetName] meditated.\nAnd meditated.\nAnd meditated.\nUntil briefly, [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s spirit left the meditating body and for a split second, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was able to look behind the veil of the world and see a glance of Nirvana.\nHowever, some fairies interrupted [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] meditation and therefore much of Nirvana still remains hidden, but the knowledge, the pure sight of it brought [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] enlightenment!"
 th_bdh_meditation_events.11.a: "With this knowledge I now know how to reign over my realm better."

 th_bdh_meditation_set_cd: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] will not be able to meditate for the next §Y5 years§!."
 th_harmonization_events.11.t: "Concept of Nirvana"
 th_harmonization_events.11.d: "The followers of the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] faith have increasingly come to integrate Gensokyan-Buddhistic concepts and rites into their daily life. A recent trend is to identify the concept of Nirvana with their own ideas of the afterlife. This interpretation is somewhat unorthodox to the scholar experts of our [Root.GovernmentName], but it has allowed the faithful [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] to integrate a number of Gensokyan-Buddhistic concepts, rites, constants and classical teaching in their theology.\nThere is some debate in the palace halls of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] if this is the right and proper way on the path for the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] adherents to elevate themselves from barbarians to our kind."
 th_harmonization_events.11.a: "We must teach them the proper ways!"
 th_harmonization_events.11.b: "Let us accommodate this abstraction."
 th_harmonization_events.12.t: "Translations of the Classics"
 th_harmonization_events.12.d: "The [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName]s are a people with strong traditions and rites and their adherence to the archaic language of their own teachings is holding them back from progressing towards enlightenment. If they are to ever elevate themselves from the Barbarian Yi of this world, we must perhaps ensure that the classics and the proper rites are available for them to digest in their own language.\nThere are some scholars that have already begun to create such works. Should we encourage them to continue synthesizing their old religious concepts with the sublime principles of Byakuren Hijiri?"
 th_harmonization_events.12.a: "Let them create their own version of proper form."
 th_harmonization_events.12.b: "This would be a travesty on our ideology!"
 th_harmonization_events.13.t: "Faith of [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName]"
 th_harmonization_events.13.d: "Our trusted minister and confidant, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] has worked closely with our [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] community in order to help them elevate their intolerant culture. Surprised at [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] findings, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has started to adopt many [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] concepts after studying their science and literature intensely. Many worry that [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has gotten too taken in by [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] ways. Some even claim that our [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetTitle] has secretly converted, shaming [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] ancestors and the [Root.GovernmentName] alike."
 th_harmonization_events.13.a: "Depose this [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetWomanMan]!"
 th_harmonization_events.13.b: "We have much to learn from the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] people."
 th_harmonization_events.14.t: "Rights and Rite"
 th_harmonization_events.14.d: "While they are part of our [Root.GovernmentName] some [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] traditions can be very hard to stomach. Civilized people are supposed to abide by what is right and logical according to the Gensokyan-Buddhistic teachings, but these men and women have many customs in direct contradiction of such rules. Our officials in [harmonization_province.GetName] have been struggling with the locals who insist on their barbarous ways."
 th_harmonization_events.14.a: "Barbarians!"
 th_harmonization_events.14.b: "Such minor things do not concern us."
 th_harmonization_events.15.t: "Empowering the Office of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 th_harmonization_events.15.d: "While the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] are still finding their way, they have some customs and rites that we might make use of. As their traditions and ceremonies regarding rulership already contains a concept of a high worldly power such as our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] this is something we could make good use of. Local officials in [harmonization_province.GetName] have already been doing so but it has been suggested that we make use of [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] ceremonies even at higher levels. Others argue that we would be shaming our ancestors and turning our back on what is proper if we allowed these traditions to contaminate ours."
 th_harmonization_events.15.a: "I like the sound of this..."
 th_harmonization_events.15.b: "It is the shameful officials we need to deal with!"
 th_harmonization_events.16.t: "Bringing Enlightenment to the Intolerant"
 th_harmonization_events.16.d: "Over time the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName]s have come to take to many of our customs. When our [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetTitle] visited the area of [harmonization_province.GetName] [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetSheHe] found that they are still far from understanding Byakuren's teachings, however, and when a local influential landholder invited [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetHerHim] to participate in a naming ceremony for a child named for its father that was the last drop.\n[Root.Dip_Advisor.GetTitle] returned from the area with a very low opinion of the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName]s and of their prospects to ever count themselves among the civilized people of the world."
 th_harmonization_events.16.a: "Let us civilize them then."
 th_harmonization_events.16.b: "I think our [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetTitle] may be the barbarian here..."
 th_harmonization_events.17.t: "[harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] Civilization"
 th_harmonization_events.17.d: "Some of the non-believers are more susceptible to reason and intellect than others. The [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName]s of [harmonization_province.GetName] have already taken to many of our traditions, from the more important to even minor things. Visiting foreigners have a hard time telling the region apart from [Root.GetName] proper as apart from some minor eccentricities the [Root.Capital.Culture.GetName] language, names and customs seem as [Root.GetAdjective] as any part of the [Root.GetName] [Root.GovernmentName]."
 th_harmonization_events.17.a: "Progress!"
 th_harmonization_events.17.b: "We must use this opportunity regionally!"
 th_harmonization_events.18.t: "The Disgrace of [Root.Heir.GetName]"
 th_harmonization_events.18.d: "The rule of our great [Root.GovernmentName] is building on the religiosity of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] have in the past prided themselves on leading through example, observing strict etiquette, personal austerity and carefully weeding out those that do not conform to this ideal.\nIt is therefore with a heavy heart that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has observed the development of [Root.Heir.GetName]. Far from an ideal [Root.Heir.GetWomanMan] our Buddhistic heir is often described by [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] teachers as a petty person, focused on immediate gain and emotional pleasures while taunting the values of Buddhism. There are, however, factions at court that would be most dismayed if we abandoned [Root.Heir.GetName], a new heir would not have their support."
 th_harmonization_events.18.a: "Such a [Root.Heir.GetWomanMan] is not fit for our realm."
 th_harmonization_events.18.b: "We need the support of the factions behind the [Root.Heir.GetTitle]."
 ###EVENTS FOR Touhou Taoist###
 th_taoism_events.1.t: "Conflicts between Taoists and the Youkai"
 th_taoism_events.1.d: "The Youkai in our realm have been unusually uncooperative lately. They fear that our philosophy of foreign youkai extinction goes too far and is contradicting the ways of Taoism. Likewise the aspiring Shrine Maidens, who follow the word of Toyosatomimi, have become more and more irritated that youkai live within our borders."
 th_taoism_events.1.a: "Support the Taoist Priests."
 th_taoism_events.1.b: "Support the Youkai."
 th_taoism_events.1.c: "Support no side."
 th_taoism_events.1.c.tt: "Lost support"
 th_taoism_events.2.t: "Influx of Alchemic Ideas"
 th_taoism_events.2.d: "Our society has shown a great interest in the high art of alchemy, which in return brought many new ideas for our apothecaries. Those new, innovative ideas will speed up new discoveries in science."
 th_taoism_events.2.a: "Excellent."
 th_taoism_events.3.t: "Taoistic Discipline"
 th_taoism_events.3.d: "The difference between religion and a life philosophy is blurred for the Taoistic faith. Not many generals are religious, but they all appreciate the discipline and concentration one has to bring when walking the Taoistic way. One of those generals made this path by himself some time ago and returns now to serve our army in a way, which has not been seen before."
 th_taoism_events.3.a: "Excellent."
 th_taoism_events.4.t: "The Art of Toyosatomimi's Diplomacy"
 th_taoism_events.4.d: "Miko no Toyosatomimi is the pioneer of Taoism in Gensokyo, but she has little interests in teaching the Taoistic ways. Her disciples are more court servants than actual adepts of the Taoistic ways...\nHowever, those disciples live with Miko in the same court and learn from her the art of diplomacy. They can be proof useful for the relations with our neighbors."
 th_taoism_events.4.a: "Improve relations with our neighbors."
 th_taoism_events.4.b: "Let them learn more from Miko."
 th_taoism_events.5.t: "Taoist Priests settle in Capital Area"
 th_taoism_events.5.d: "The zealous Taoist priests decided to settle in our capital state. Although their job to convert more people to our faith isn't over, the state of our realm allows them to take their work easier, which is why they are able to fulfill their secondary task, the collection of donations, in our cities."
 th_taoism_events.5.a: "This red-white shrine maiden could take an example of our priests!"
 th_taoism_events.6.t: "Disciples in Conflict with the Nobility"
 th_taoism_events.6.desc: "A drama happened in the court: the nobility, who leads [Root.GetName]'s army, was under heavy criticism from the Taoistic disciples. They call the generals as impious and wicked as their style of warfare is contradicting the philosophy of Taoism. Now, both parties ask for [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s support."
 th_taoism_events.6.a: "Side with the nobility."
 th_taoism_events.6.b: "Side with the disciples."
 th_taoism_events.6.c: "Punish both sides."
 th_taoism_events.6.c.tt: "Equal punishment"
 th_taoism_events.7.t: "Conversion of [Root.GetName]"
 th_taoism_events.7.d: "It seems the philosophy of our faith has convinced the people of [Root.GetName], resulting in them abandoning the customs of their ancestors and adopting the ways of Taoism."
 th_taoism_events.7.a: "I knew they would adapt to our world view."
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.1.t: "Wuxing - the Five Ways"
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.1.desc: "In the Taoistic philosophy and faith there is the teaching of Wuxing - the Five Ways. It is a cosmological model of the circle, which holds the world together. The theory describes how the five types of chi dominates at different times. Those five types are portrayed as wood (period of growth), fire (period of flowering), earth (period of transition), metal (the period of harvest) and water (the period of retreat). It's a never ending circle and many aspects of our society - from the clerics over the burghers to even the nobility - are influenced by the mood caused by the current cycle.\nBut even an endless circle needs a starting point. With which element should [Root.GetName] start?"
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.1.a: "Wood."
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.1.b: "Fire."
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.1.c: "Earth."
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.1.d: "Metal."
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.1.e: "Water."
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.2.t: "The Way of Wood"
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.2.d: "Wood - this is the element of the period, which is about the beginning of new life, creation and wood itself."
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.2.a: "The Period of Wood has begun."
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.3.t: "The Way of Fire"
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.3.d: "Fire - this is the element of the period, which is about developing, energy and fire itself."
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.3.a: "The Period of Fire has begun."
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.4.t: "The Way of Earth"
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.4.d: "Earth - this is the element of the period, which is about conversion, entering a new state and earth itself."
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.4.a: "The Period of Earth has begun."
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.5.t: "The Way of Metal"
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.5.d: "Metal - this is the element of the period, which is about maturity and harvest as well as metal itself."

 th_taoism_wuxing_events.6.t: "The Way of Water"
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.6.d: "Water - this is the element of the period, which is about storage, retreat and quiet as well as water itself."
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.6.a: "The Period of Water has begun."
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.7.t: "The previous Period"
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.7.d: "Although the circle is a natural phenomenon it is possible for our high Taoistic clerics and the alchemists to manipulate those energies, which allows them to set the period progress back to the previous element."
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.7.a: "Ok."
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.8.t: "Control the Period"
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.8.d: "Although the circle is a natural phenomenon it is possible for our high Taoistic clerics and the alchemists to manipulate those energies, which allows them to trigger the period, which controls the current element."
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.8.a: "Ok."
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.9.t: "Destroy the Period"
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.9.d: "Although the circle is a natural phenomenon it is possible for our high Taoistic clerics and the alchemists to manipulate those energies, which allows them to trigger the period, which destroys the current element."
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.9.a: "Ok."
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.10.t: "The next Period"
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.10.d: "Although the circle is a natural phenomenon it is possible for our high Taoistic clerics and the alchemists to manipulate those energies, which allows them to skip this period and allow the next element to take its place."
 th_taoism_wuxing_events.10.a: "Ok." 
 th_taoism_events.18.t: "Soldiers want to become Disciples"
 th_taoism_events.18.desc: "The life in the army is harsh and everything but peaceful. It is a job of great distress and not everyone is fit for it. As a result of this many soldiers deserted the army and started a new life in the different laboratories and temples as disciples of the Taoistic ways."
 th_taoism_events.18.a: "Let them be disciples."
 th_taoism_events.18.b: "Get them back in our army immediately!"
 th_taoism_events.19.t: "Disciple Reform"
 th_taoism_events.19.desc: "Unlike the other religions in Gensokyo, Gensokyan-Taoism is not only managed by its Taoist Priest, but also by its disciples. Those are the adepts, who want to learn from Miko Toyosatomimi the Taoistic ways. And even though they are more used as court servants than really religious pupils, their service in both for the state as well as in alchemy brought some great results. One of those results is a worked out reform for our [Root.GovernmentName]."
 th_taoism_events.19.a: "Wonderful."
 th_taoism_events.20.t: "Delegation of the Disciples fails!"
 th_taoism_events.20.desc: "It may be not obvious, but the disciples of Gensokyan-Taoism are the back pillar of our court and religious institutions. Through an incompetent advisor's mismanagement the delegation of the disciples is all over the place. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has only the means to manage two aspects, but one has to be kept short."
 th_taoism_events.20.a: "Well, let's cut the budget for the missionaries."
 th_taoism_events.20.b: "I guess the treasury management will be quite tricky for some time."
 th_taoism_events.20.c: "The foreign policy will have to suffer a little bit."
 th_taoism_events.21.t: "The Study of Water"
 th_taoism_events.21.desc: "In reference to Wuxing, the Circle of the Five Ways, some disciples started to study the attributes of water and its meaning in the circle. For inspiration those disciples started to leave the temples and the court and do expeditions on the sea. While their curiosity is admirable, their force is heavily missed at the court and in the temples. On the other hand if we let them continue their research, the Burghers would most likely appreciate the knowledge about the naval warfare those disciples find."
 th_taoism_events.21.a: "Let them continue their research."
 th_taoism_events.21.b: "The temples and the court are more important!"
 th_taoism_events.22.t: "[Root.Heir.GetName]"
 th_taoism_events.22.desc: "Those around [Root.Heir.GetName] agree that the child is showing promise beyond what was initially expected. [Root.Heir.GetSheHeCap] is learning quickly and [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] skills are improving by the day.\nTraditionally the heirs of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] should spend their young years studying the art of alchemy, diplomacy and warfare. However, the topics are quite complex and it will take special teachers to teach [Root.Heir.GetName] one of the three aspects properly."
 th_taoism_events.22.a: "Hire a teacher for alchemy."
 th_taoism_events.22.b: "[Root.Heir.GetSheHe] needs to learn diplomacy."
 th_taoism_events.22.c: "A general should teach [Root.Heir.GetHerHim]." 
 th_taoism_events.22.d: "I will teach my child myself!"
 th_taoism_events.22.e: "We have no extra resources to spare for [Root.Heir.GetHerHim]."
 th_taoism_events.23.t: "Examination of Administrators"
 th_taoism_events.23.desc: "The ancient Taoists of Japan have long felt that a good way to ensure efficient administration according to Taoistic ideals is to hold general examinations for all administrators. This works well for a country with generations of experience to draw upon, something we do not have.\nThe current lack of both administrators and teachers might be remedied by attracting some of those that have failed the examinations in neighboring countries but we would be paying a high price for an uncertain commodity."
 th_taoism_events.23.a: "It is a risk we must take."
 th_taoism_events.23.b: "Let us seek talent among our own instead."
 th_taoism_events.24.t: "Necromancy"
 th_taoism_events.24.desc: "In a war many soldiers die on both sides in battle and both parties try to recruit more people for the meat grinder - that is the ugly nature of war. But there might be a way, a means, to avoid this problem for the future duration of this war. Some of the disciples of the Taoistic Necromancer, Seiga Kaku, completed their training and offered us their service during these dire times. Even though their power might be tempting, we should not forget that the dead should rest in peace. If we take this offer our people will be shocked in our [Root.GovernmentName]."
 th_taoism_events.24.a: "This might not excite my people, but we need their power!"
 th_taoism_events.24.b: "We cannot allow us to fall so deeply."
 th_taoism_events.25.t: "Donation from the Disciples"
 th_taoism_events.25.desc: "Due to the destruction the war caused in our country, some disciples decided to spend the money they got from their work as well as donate the donations they gained to us as well as to the poor."
 th_taoism_events.25.a: "Neat."
 th_taoism_events.26.t: "Talented Disciple manages the Treasury"
 th_taoism_events.26.desc: "Apparently, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] had a good instinct when [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] picked [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] personal court treasurer. The chosen disciple not only manages the money well, but also finds some undocumented cash in some of the chests. According to his advice, it would be smart to invest this money."
 th_taoism_events.26.a: "Invest it in mercantilism."
 th_taoism_events.26.b: "Invest it in the fight against inflation."
 th_taoism_events.26.c: "I will invest it later somewhere else."
 th_taoism_events.27.t: "Xiaoren?"
 th_taoism_events.27.d: "The rule of our great [Root.GovernmentName] is the foremost responsibility and privilege of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] have in the past prided themselves on leading through example, observing strict etiquette, personal austerity and carefully weeding out those that do not conform to this ideal.\nIt is therefore with a heavy heart that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has observed the development of [Root.Heir.GetName].

 th_taoism_wuxing_events.0.desc: "The Circle of Wuxing is a key part of Gensokyo's Taoism and many aspects of the cycles find their way in our nation. Fortunately, there is a note for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to keep an overview of what each cycle brings and in what natural order they come.\nThe natural cycle order goes like that: Wood -> Fire -> Earth -> Metal -> Water -> Wood"

They are zealous followers of the Hakurei God deity and when they saw our people worshipping the Hakurei God, they felt like they were home.\nSome days later they made an appearance at the court and wished to show our army some tricks and tips for danmaku battles. With a little engagement from our military advisors, we could even convince them to stay longer for better training."
 th_deity_events.4.a: "We should keep them a little longer."
 th_deity_events.4.b: "We don't have the means for a longer training."
 th_deity_events.5.t: "A Special Gift"
 th_deity_events.5.desc: "So, you have chosen me as your deity, haven't you? Well, that's a little bit unexpected. Usually the gods of Gensokyo get all the attention. Oh well, then I should reward you. How about you tell me what you desire and I will get you something to fulfill this wish..."
 th_deity_events.5.a: "My realm could use a strong military."
 th_deity_events.5.b: "A little bit money wouldn't hurt."
 th_deity_events.5.c: "Can I have some vacations please?"
 th_deity_events.5.d: "I could need a little help in inner diplomacy."
 th_deity_events.5.e: "Ehm... I think I refuse"
 th_deity_events.5.e.tt: "Ohh. Well, I will keep the gifts for myself then."
 th_deity_events.6.t: "Zashiki-Warashi"
 th_deity_events.6.desc: "I see your people are worshipping me and trying to appeal me with faith. I am not a god, but I appreciate it.\nHmm... I guess in return I will allow you to use my special spies and diplomats, the Zashiki-Warashis. Take good care of them."
 th_deity_events.6.a: "Thank you, Yukari."
 th_deity_events.7.t: "Spies out of the Gaps"
 th_deity_events.7.desc: "My spies found some ... totally formal correct and approved documents, that this province from [th_hkr_shinto_target_country.GetName] actually belongs to [Root.GetName]."
 th_deity_events.7.a: "Neat."
 th_deity_events.8.t: "An unlikely Quartet"
 th_deity_events.8.desc: "Time, space, dimensions - those are concepts which are not easy to explain for a mortal. But I refuse to think that it is important for you to understand it. More importantly to know is that four souls had it pretty bad in their life and got ... well, what do you people call it nowadays? \"Isekai'd\"? Anyway, there are now four guys, who now found their ways through one of my gaps now into Gensokyo. You can have one of those four very promising people. I will keep the other three for my own court."
 th_deity_events.8.a: "The man who dies often sounds like a fun person."
 th_deity_events.8.b: "I take the one who truly stands for gender equality."
 th_deity_events.8.c: "An undead will surely be the overlord of the sea."
 th_deity_events.8.d: "I take the battle mage." 
 th_deity_events.8.e: "Yukari... you know, that THIS is your court, right?"
 th_deity_events.8.e.tt: "Oh, right. Well, then of course we take all four of them."
 th_deity_events.9.t: "Hecatia, Mistress of Hell"
 th_deity_events.9.desc: "Hecatia is not only the patron of impressive fashion sense, but also the mistress of Hell. As our realm focuses more and more on the worship of her, they also get more and more scared of being sent to hell.\nThis fear increases a lot more when news comes from provinces, which were held by rebel scum, that the occupiers all got banished into oblivion. It seems like our deity is protecting our realm."
 th_deity_events.9.a: "She may be mistress of Hell, but she is also our Guardian Angel."
 th_deity_events.10.t: "Three Body Aspects"
 th_deity_events.10.desc: "Hecatia is a benevolent and supporting deity and stands for her followers. But she also helps outside times of great need. Her ability - splitting into the three divine entities, which represent the forces holding Gensokyo together - allows her to be active at multiple places at once. Hecatia is so friendly and allows us to pick one of her three bodies to serve our realm."
 th_deity_events.10.a: "I choose the Earth Aspect."
 th_deity_events.10.b: "I choose the Moon Aspect."
 th_deity_events.10.c: "I choose the Otherworld Aspect."
 th_deity_events.11.t: "The Eccentricities of Hecatia"
 th_deity_events.11.desc: "Unlike the other gods of Gensokyo, Hecatia is a little bit ... unique when it comes down to luxuries and especially fashion. And even though money is not a problem for her, it has become a little tradition to collect money to support her fashion choices. Of course this is a complete optional donation, but pious followers of Hecatia would appreciate this gift to her just as much as she does."
 th_deity_events.11.a: "Well, I think a little bit of money to appeal the followers is ok."
 th_deity_events.11.b: "Oh, optional you say? Fine by me."
 th_deity_events.11.c: "Hey, my fashion sense isn't THAT expensive..."
 th_deity_events.12.t: "Rule of Authority"
 th_deity_events.12.desc: "Hell is a harsh place and only the strongest and the most cunning can reign supreme over the other residents of Hell. As a result of this, the leader of this place must show their absolute power either on their own or through their army. A concept which is true in the normal realms of Gensokyo too."
 th_deity_events.12.a: "I am the Authority over my court!"
 th_deity_events.12.b: "I am the Authority over my army!"
 th_deity_events.13.t: "Fort Backdoors"
 th_deity_events.13.desc: "At first our soldiers thought they were dreaming. Hallucinating. But when they practiced the sieging of a fort, they noticed a magical door at the back of the practice castle, which allowed them to take it way faster. Apparently, this door isn't specific to this very castle but to every fortified province our soldiers visit. It is like Okina herself wants us to occupy any fortress our army will have to deal with."
 th_deity_events.13.a: "With those backdoors not many forts can withstand us!"
 th_deity_events.14.t: "The many Secrets of the Court"
 th_deity_events.14.desc: "The court of [Root.GetName] houses [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s closest advisors. However, not all advisors act in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] interests, but in their own. Plots and intrigues are very common in the court. To our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s luck, Okina knows exactly which parts of the court have the most dangerous secrets. One of her backup dancers is offering us one of the three plots of the estates."
 th_deity_events.14.a: "Tell me about the taboos of the shrine maidens."
 th_deity_events.14.b: "Tell me about the secrets of the human guilds."
 th_deity_events.14.c: "Tell me about the intrigues of the youkai."
 th_deity_events.14.d: "I know many secrets..."
 th_deity_events.15.t: "Dancing Explorer"
 th_deity_events.15.desc: "Okina is not a goddess with few followers, but with close - yet dispensable - advisors: her Backup Dancers. But they are not forever useful for her and when the dancers overstay their welcome in Okina's realm, they get replaced. However, instead of just getting them rid, our deity noticed our people's deity and decided to give [Root.GetName]'s court her redundant, but quite curious dancer. It is up to us of how we shall use her."
 th_deity_events.15.a: "This dancer should help us out in our colonies."
 th_deity_events.15.b: "She will do a fine job as an explorer."
 th_deity_events.15.c: "She should use her curiosity in the New World."
 th_deity_events.16.t: "Open Door to a new Province!"
 th_deity_events.16.desc: "It appears that our colonial engagement drew our deity's attention. The idea of us discovering the secrets of the New World appeals to Okina! She decided to give us a little bit of support and opened two doors: one goes to completely new, unclaimed land, the other leads us to our already existing colony. Which door should our colonists step through?"
 th_deity_events.16.a: "Let them take the door to the new province."
 th_deity_events.16.b: "Guide them to our existing colony."
 th_deity_events.17.t: "Gift of the Aki Sisters"
 th_deity_events.17.desc: "The Aki Sisters are benevolent goddesses, who have only so many followers and support. Because of this, they appreciate any support they get way more than any other deity. This year, their harvest was exceptionally well and made them a considerable profit. Now they are selling it and sharing the money with the people, who donate their faith for them."
 th_deity_events.17.a: "That's so nice of them!"
 th_deity_events.18.t: "Aki Sisters bless our Crops"
 th_deity_events.18.desc: "Because of their small group of followers, the Aki Sisters have more time and energy to give to the very few who have chosen them as their deities - those few include us as well. As thanks, they came personally to our farmers and blessed their crops!"
 th_deity_events.18.a: "Blessed be their hearts!"
 th_deity_events.19.t: "The Aki Sisters' Experiences"
 th_deity_events.19.desc: "Both, Shizuha and Minoriko are goddesses, who have lived more lives than any human and most of the youkai. These experiences of so many years combined with their relative long downtime outside autumn both sisters can share their wisdom regarding harvest organization, fertility, calm mindsets and what not."
 th_deity_events.19.a: "Tell me more about the secrets of fertility..."
 th_deity_events.19.b: "[Root.Heir.GetName] will greatly benefit from their experiences."
 th_deity_events.19.c: "A calm mindset sure sounds useful."
 th_deity_events.20.t: "Beauty of Fall"
 th_deity_events.20.desc: "This year's Fall season is a beautiful spectacle of colorful leaves - especially in [th_hkr_shinto_target_province.GetName]. The magic of the Aki Sisters motivated many pilgrims to wander and settle in [th_hkr_shinto_target_province.GetName] now."
 th_deity_events.20.a: "Nice."
 th_deity_events.20.b: "Fall is indeed the best season."
 th_deity_events.21.t: "Junko's Fury"
 th_deity_events.21.desc: "No other deity is more violent, vengeful and angry than Junko - aspects which can describe our people quite well during these times of war. The question however is, if we should follow her example and embrace her fury or try to maintain the teachings of Hakurei Shintoism and keep a calm head."
 th_deity_events.21.a: "Dire times require dire actions."
 th_deity_events.21.b: "No. We shouldn't let fury consume our mind."
 th_deity_events.22.t: "Purification"
 th_deity_events.22.desc: "Reports have been made from a province that Junko is personally visiting them to do a Purification..."
 th_deity_events.22.a: "Hopefully, its meaning is better than it sounds like..."
 th_deity_events.23.t: "Purge within the Army"
 th_deity_events.23.desc: "Our deity Junko is fighting an endless war against the Lunarian on the moon - and for this task she only needs the best of the best of warriors she can get. To achieve this goal she developed a system involving her purifying ability to purge her army from the weak. Apparently, this cruel act found its way into the heads of our generals, who are now considering the same to increase the army quality. But in the end, it is [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s decision."
 th_deity_events.23.a: "Purge the weak!"
 th_deity_events.23.b: "Only the strongest shall serve!"
 th_deity_events.23.c: "That's a little too brutal - even for an army..."
 th_deity_events.24.t: "Chinese Legacy"
 th_deity_events.24.desc: "Junko wasn't always a deity of Gensokyo. Before she purified her existence, she was known as the wife of an emperor of the ancient Xia-Dynasty in China. But this was a thing of the past. Now she brought her Chinese Legacy - the high art of warfare and the concept of the Mandate of Heaven - to Gensokyo and to all of those, who follow her."
 th_deity_events.24.a: "We will honor this legacy."
 th_deity_events.25.t: "Motherly Affection"
 th_deity_events.25.desc: "Even though Junko is mostly known as the deity of vengeance and wrath, she is also the patron of family and mothers. In a way, she has become a symbol of hope for families, whose fathers and sons are in wars and it is due to the worship of Junko, what gives them the strength to withstand those hard times."
 th_deity_events.25.a: "Junko's blessing upon the families."
 th_deity_events.26.t: "Power of the Word"
 th_deity_events.26.desc: "Sagume Kishin is a powerful being, whose ability is to let the reverse of any possible event happen when she mentions it. It's a very dangerous ability if used without any thought, but in the right hands it can bring massive benefits. Those, who worship Kishin, have a chance to get to enjoy her power for a brief moment - only enough time to say one word, which manipulates our country's fate."
 th_deity_events.26.a: "Poverty."
 th_deity_events.26.b: "Shipwreck."
 th_deity_events.27.t: "Strangers from another World"
 th_deity_events.27.desc: "Some weird strangers once visited our nation. When they saw the might of the [Root.GetAdjective] navy as well as the sailors' piety towards Kishin they decided to visit [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s court to meet with our admirals. Apparently, those strangers are Lunarians, who got banished from their home and now seek a new purpose, where their knowledge of Lunarian naval warfare can be useful again."
 th_deity_events.27.a: "They will be from great benefit for our navy."
 th_deity_events.28.t: "The Art of Communication"
 th_deity_events.28.desc: "Due to our people worshipping Sagume Kishin, the goddess of few words, they got inspired by her thoughtfulness of choosing the right words. Many of our merchants started to become quick-witted in her honor and their skills in trading have been improving a lot since. The Burghers are more than happy with this development."
 th_deity_events.28.a: "Less is more."
 th_deity_events.29.t: "The Silent Way"
 th_deity_events.29.desc: "In recent times our people have become a lot less ... vocal about their problems. It seems like everyone found a way to get their quiet and peaceful life."
 th_deity_events.29.a: "Let's hope it stays this way."
 th_deity_events.30.t: "Inspired Architects"
 th_deity_events.30.desc: "With the adoption of Shinki as our official deity, her indirect influence over our country grew. Especially in the topic of architecture. Many architects and builders are interested in using the Makaian architecture for our buildings. However, they will need some support from the government if their dream should become true."
 th_deity_events.30.a: "Of course they get our support."
 th_deity_events.30.b: "We don't have the resources for it."
 th_deity_events.31.t: "Shinki's Scripts"
 th_deity_events.31.desc: "It is commonly known that Shinki's realm, Makai, was created completely from scratch by Shinki. However, it is a mystery how exactly she did - until one day, a witch came to our shrines with scripts and plans. Although they don't explain how her power of creation exactly works, they give a great insight into the calculations and planning Shinki did for her realm."
 th_deity_events.31.a: "[Root.GetName] will greatly benefit from this."
 th_deity_events.32.t: "[Root.GetName] gets flooded by Makaian Gas!"
 th_deity_events.32.desc: "The province [Root.GetName], which is currently under siege, reports of a strange mist filling the city! It comes from the shrines and it affects only the enemy in our land! It can only be caused by our deity Shinki, who wants to protect us!"
 th_deity_events.32.a: "Praised be Shinki!"
 th_deity_events.33.t: "Shinki's Influence grows in [Root.GetName]!"
 th_deity_events.33.desc: "At first it seemed everything normal at the shrine of [Root.GetName]. But after a closer look it is apparent that there are a lot of idols of Shinki and her creations not only in the shrine but also in the town too! It is said that those idols bring luck to them and increase their inspiration in the business of our government. If we let them continue they will bring a lot of good ideas. However, the province will most likely fall under Shinki's religious control."
 th_deity_events.33.a: "Only new ideas can bring our country further."
 th_deity_events.33.b: "We must stop Shinki's influence!"
 th_deity_events.34.t: "Workshop ideas for [Root.GetName]"
 th_deity_events.34.desc: "Keiki, the deity of the worker and craftsmen, has gained a lot of popularity in our realm. In her honor, a group of artists, craftsmen and shrine maidens got the idea to build an idol workshop in [Root.GetName]."
 th_deity_events.34.a: "Sounds good to me."
 th_deity_events.34.b: "There resources are better used somewhere else."
 th_deity_events.35.t: "Idol Soldiers join the Army!"
 th_deity_events.35.desc: "Our deity Keiki noticed our devotion to her. As thanks for the faith she gathers from our people, she sent a battalion of idol soldiers to join our army!"
 th_deity_events.35.a: "Great!"
 th_deity_events.36.t: "Lectures of Keiki"
 th_deity_events.36.desc: "Keiki fights for the human spirits, which are trapped in the Beastial Hell. Due to the constant warfare and authority system of Hell, Keiki developed a system, which allows her to increase her realm's glory by increasing her power grip on the provinces. Although it sounds bad, the human spirits are more appealed by the idea of being ruled by Keiki than under the beasts.\nThe design of this rule is written down in lectures, which somehow found their way in the hands of one of our Shrine Maidens. She donated those lectures to [Root.Monarch.GetName] for the future of [Root.GetName]."
 th_deity_events.36.a: "I will use those lectures wisely."
 th_deity_events.37.t: "Mayumi's Army"
 th_deity_events.37.desc: "A Haniwa with a great battalion of Haniwa soldiers marched through our country. But they didn't come as invaders. They were led by Mayumi Joutouguu and heard of our people's support for Keiki. She offers us her and her troops services."
 th_deity_events.37.a: "Well, I gladly take this offer."
 th_deity_events.37.b: "I have to decline. Sorry, Mayumi."
 th_deity_events.37.c: "Offer? Mayumi, did you forget that you serve me already?"
 th_deity_events.38.t: "Misfortune of War"
 th_deity_events.38.desc: "War... War never changes. While the way of how a war is fought may vary over the years the horrors and destruction it brings never changes. It is a time of death and great misfortune. Luckily, our deity Hina Kagiyama likes to collect the misfortune of our people and bring hope for a better future."
 th_deity_events.38.a: "Hina blesses us."
 th_deity_events.39.t: "Visit from Hina"
 th_deity_events.39.desc: "Hina isn't used to people who donate their faith and follow her way. Due to this, Hina decided to visit us and thank us personally. She wants to show her appreciation by offering us to use her ability to free one aspect of [Root.GetName] from bad luck."
 th_deity_events.39.a: "Our administrators could use some better luck."
 th_deity_events.39.b: "Our diplomats could use some better luck."

 th_deity_events.40.a.tt: "Every devastated province loses 10 devastation."
 th_deity_events.41.t: "An insane Suggestion"
 th_deity_events.41.desc: "Our overzealous Shrine Maiden got lately an insane idea: in order to collect more faith for Hina and her shrine she asked us to inflict misfortune on our people. We can cause more misfortune by forcing more people to join our forces, taxing the burghers or making the practices in the army more sadistic. However, it is obvious that this shrine maiden doesn't have the best mental health."
 th_deity_events.41.a: "We need more soldiers anyway..."
 th_deity_events.41.b: "We could press more money out of the burghers while we're at it."
 th_deity_events.41.c: "More sadistic discipline actions should help."
 th_deity_events.41.d: "She is insane! Send this Shrine maiden into exile!"
 th_deity_events.42.t: "Sanae's Fans"
 th_deity_events.42.desc: "Our recruit master couldn't believe his eyes when this happened: Many young men have enlisted themselves in our army very recently! Apparently, somebody spread the rumor that Sanae Kochiya, our current deity, would love to go out with a tough man and now a horde of men want to prove themselves by becoming soldiers."
 th_deity_events.42.a: "Well, I won't complain, but becoming a soldier for a girl's heart..."
 th_deity_events.42.b: "Oh oh... those are a lot of fans..."
 th_deity_events.42.c: "Send them back to their mommies. We don't need them in our army!"

 th_deity_events.43.desc: "Our country is devastated by war and our government is close to the collapse. Everyone seems to be about to lose hope for a better future - until one night.

 th_deity_events.44.t: "Wonders of Modernization"
 th_deity_events.44.desc: "The Moriya religion is a modern take on the rather stoic Gensokyan Shintoism. It brings many new ideas from the outworld and even technology. But due to resources being rather limited for this technology only a few can enjoy the modernization caused by Kochiya and her close advisors. Luckily, we are one of those few countries who receives the gift of technology."
 th_deity_events.44.a: "And we sure will put this gift to good use."

 th_deity_events.45.desc: "Some of Sanae's trained Shrine Maidens decided to leave the Shrine to move into the province [Root.GetName]. Not only will they enrich the city [Root.GetCapitalName] but also will they make sure that no heretical ideas will remain in the province."

 th_deity_events.46.t: "A special Shrine Maiden"
 th_deity_events.46.desc: "In the Moriya Shrine a shrine maiden, who had the luck to get to train with Sanae, absolved her final tests. Now this maiden has started her own journey through Gensokyo and travels through many countries. One day, she came to us and decided to stay a bit to help us spread the word of Moriya."

 th_deity_events.47.desc: "[Root.GetName] is one of our fortified provinces in our realm and as such is an important, strategic target. Because of this, our engineers and soldiers pay a lot of attention to keep the fort running. In their last check-up, however, they noticed something strange: the walls of the fort got a new, incredibly hard layer of defense made out of stone and earth. It is apparent that this is the work of our deity Suwako Moriya, who blessed this fort for us!"

They claim to be Suwako's personal disciples, who were in their last phase of their training, which was serving a court with their abilities. But only one can serve us while the other two continue their journey through the other countries of Gensokyo."
 th_deity_events.50.a: "I take the youkai hunting Shrine Maiden."

 th_deity_events.52.t: "Divine Inspiration"
 th_deity_events.52.desc: "Kanako Yasaka isn't only a goddess of the sky, but also a militaristic leader and patron over merchants and soldiers. Especially for the military, she is a symbol for victory in a glorious battle, which is why our generals increased the quality and quantity of training for our army."
 th_deity_events.52.a: "Great news!"
 th_deity_events.53.t: "Shrine Maiden reporting for Duty"
 th_deity_events.53.desc: "Due to the connection of Kanako with warfare, it is no surprise that some zealous shrine maidens want to show their devotion in battle. One of those maidens presented exceptionally potential to be a great leader. Now it is up to [Root.Monarch.GetName] in which area she shall serve."
 th_deity_events.53.a: "She shall lead our armies to victory!"
 th_deity_events.53.b: "She shall lead our navies to victory!"

 th_deity_events.54.desc: "Our shrine maidens donated some lucky charms to our diplomats recently. They say that those lucky charms are blessed by Kanako so their wearer gains more confidence in conversations. It is questionable if they are really blessed by Kanako or just dummies Kanako sells to make money, but apparently our diplomats love them."
 th_deity_events.54.a: "Well, as long the diplomats buy them with their own money."
 th_deity_events.55.t: "The Trade of Faith and Money"
 th_deity_events.55.desc: "Our deity is unlike the other gods of Gensokyo. Kanako sees collecting faith like a business, which means in her eyes she pays us to deliver our faith to her. As a result of this, Kanako was so friendly and sent us her payment."
 th_deity_events.55.a: "If only more gods would pay us for praying for them."
 th_deity_events.56.t: "The Religious Tributaries"
 th_deity_events.56.desc: "Religious Tributaries... this is the name our advisor came up with. It is modeled after Kanako's commercial take on religion and faith and is designed so that our subjects have to pay in faith too for our protection. In return, however, they will get the comfortable feeling that not only their overlord will protect them, but also Kanako's good intentions will be on their side too."
 th_deity_events.56.a: "Interesting..."
 th_deity_events.57.t: "Worship of a demanding Goddess"
 th_deity_events.57.desc: "Kutaka Niwatari is one of the lesser goddesses in Gensokyo, and as such she often gets little to no faith and worship compared to the other deities of Gensokyo. Although Kutaka is a very nice goddess, she still needs faith in order to gain the power to maintain her role as a gate guardian of Hell. Due to that, she is now demanding faith from our realm. One of our estates could devote some of their time and power in worshipping her."

 ###EVENTS FOR SHINKISM###
 th_shinkism_events.1.t: "The Cult of Shinki"
 th_shinkism_events.1.desc: "The times have changed in Gensokyo. Where once the goddess Shinki once played a great role in Gensokyo's fate, she now has nearly no place on the stage. But not only has Shinki fallen in oblivion, but also the other powerful figures of the North. And as a result of the invading Moriya religion, the Hakurei Tradition has become a rigid, outdated religion. Shinki, the goddess of Makai, has had enough of this!\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has a novel idea for the creation of a different sort of religion. A religion with [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] as its Supreme Deity, a happy union of the Shrine and the state. Neither Moriya, Hakurei, nor any other foreign religion, it would take a flexible approach to doctrine as fits the circumstance.\n\nSuch a cult would have its advantages. No longer subject to any higher ecclesiastical authority and the people would worship a god, who is actually in charge of Makai."

Maybe it is time to make Shinkism to the one true faith?"
 th_shinkism_events.2.a: "Yes, it is time to make Shinki to our goddess officially."

 th_shinkism_events.6.a: "Blessed be Shinki and these maidens."
 th_shinkism_events.7.t: "Donations for the Goddess"
 th_shinkism_events.7.desc: "It is a holy rule of all religions to collect money for their own deity - and Shinkism is no exception.

 th_shinkism_events.7.a: "Nope. This donation money belongs to Shinki!"
 th_shinkism_events.7.b: "I am sure Shinki won't mind if there are little bit less donations."

 th_education_events.4.fairy.desc: "Fairies aren't really good talkers. They prefer to do stuff instead. But in a world where everyone can declare you a war because your words were misunderstood as insults, it is better to have someone who can speak for the fairies. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has to fulfill this role, but unfortunately [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] isn't the most skilled diplomat.

However, our realm has the unique ability to move through not only uncolonized land but also through land which is occupied by another country. By getting a claim on a foreign province, which borders our capital, our capital will automatically move to this claimed province and return the old province to its original owner. The claim (and the city movement) will be nullified if we either claim during war or if we claim a foreign capital.\nOf course the development, religion and culture of the province before our immigration will be restored while the new province will get our primary culture, religion and our development.\nDeveloping the capital is permanent and will be transferred to the new province should the city move. Additionally, we can grow the development through §Bconquest§!. Every province we conquer will have its development saved as an invisible variable and will be immediately returned to the owner. [Root.GetName] can then make this development \"real\" by \"coring\" it - done through a decision. Each development costs 5 £adm£ to core, but it is instantly. Province, which development have been saved as a variable gain \"Koishi's Mark\", making them unavailable for saving their development again.\nFinally, no country can fabricate a claim on us."

In exchange however, they demand the attention of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and special laws, which keeps maintaining their realms a lot easier.\n[Root.GetName] possesses not normal vassals but §BSatori's Vassals§!. These subjects grant more boni than any normal vassal or march and there are a greater variety of interactions with them possible and are lot less likely to rebel when they have a high amount of development. However, additionally of consuming a Diplomatic Relation, Satori's Vassals also take one spot of §BVassal Upkeep§!. Should [Root.GetName] have more Satori's Vassals than the upkeep allows, the subjects will start getting rebellious. Every vassal above the limit will give every Satori's Vassal §R+50.0§! Liberty Desire, which can stack up to §R+400.0%§!. Should we get more than 8 Satori's Vassal, our subjects will declare independence and break away from us.\nEvery 30 days or whenever this decision is enacted the counter of subjects gets refreshed.\n"

When we get 80% Approval and at least 20 Gensokyan countries have at least 50 opinion of us, we can enact a Yama Reform (in form of a privilege), which increases our power and influence in Gensokyo.\nBe aware though that every Gensokyan country can attack us in order to get us to revoke the last reform we enacted.

Instant sources of Yama Authority are either rewards from the mission tree or are gained through the successful use of the diplomatic actions \"Enforce Gensokyan Peace\" and \"Demand Unlawful Territory\".\nThe Equilibrium itself, however, can be raised through mission rewards, through high Legitimacy, through the usage of \"Bestow Grace of the Yama\" through Higan's ideas and through the Grand Courtroom in [4983.GetName]. Additionally, your Yama Authority rises when there is Peace in Gensokyo, and for every 5 Gensokyan countries who have an opinion of at least 50 of you (up to a maximum of 30 countries).\n\nInfluence on the other hand is trickier to raise. Positive Legitimacy, Higan's ideas, the Grand Court Room and mission tree rewards increases the influence. The rest of the needed influence is increased by having Hecatia recruited as an advisor, by Peace in Gensokyo, and for every 5 Gensokyan countries existing (starting to count after the first 20 countries). Yama Reforms do, however, decrease the influence, so make sure that have new access to it as you progress.\n\nFinally, there are mechanics which remove Authority and Influence. Both will be hit hard when you have low Legitimacy, Corruption, negative Stability, any Disaster or any own or have a subject own any province in Gensokyo outside the Hell, Former Hell and Netherworld region or the Old Hell area."
