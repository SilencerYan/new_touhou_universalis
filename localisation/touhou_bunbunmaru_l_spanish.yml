 touhou_news.10.desc: "It has been a while, but we're finally back! Gensokyo's most trustworthy and objective* newspaper is back in business and in full production! For everyone curious what happened: here at the Bunbunmaru News we had some technical problems and a very, very angry White Wolf Tengu. I won't name any names, but said wolf caused major havoc and wrecked our printing press. But now they are repaired and we can finally begin to write Gensokyo's news stories, gossip and scandals! Have fun while reading!\n - Shameimaru Aya\n\n\n*It is possible that the articles are not objective."
 touhou_news.11.t: "BREAKING NEWS: SPRING DOESN'T WANT TO COME!"
 touhou_news.11.desc: "In Gensokyo, the reports of snowfall during May are still extremely high and there is no sign that spring is coming any time soon! The people fear if the winter remains there will be losses on harvests! Reimu and the other shrine maiden are already informed about this incident and preparing for an investigation. The witch Marisa and the maiden Sakuya are also concerned about this development. According to rumors some kind of dead princess is involved in this incident! IS REMILIA PLANNING TO COVER GENSOKYO WITH SCARLET MIST AGAIN?!"
 touhou_news.12.t: "YUKARI THINKS ABOUT HER OWN GLOBAL EMPIRE!"
 touhou_news.12.desc: "Although the guardian and creator of Gensokyo is very known for her very long naps she has said she would be interested into creating "the British Empire, but Gensokyan"! Here at the Bunbunmaru Newspaper we don't have any idea what she means, but we will definitely keep our eyes and cameras on her and report to you, what the gap hag is planning!"
 touhou_news.13.t: "PRICE OF GRAIN IS EXPLODING!"
 touhou_news.13.desc: "Yuyuko, the mistress of Netherworld, did it again! Her never-ending hunger consumed the grain of an entire season and the price for bread is exploding! Fortunately, she made the following statement: \"What is the matter anyway? Here in Gensokyo we have so much harvest thanks to the Aki Sisters, so the little bit of food I eat cannot hurt the economy...\". We confronted Yuyuko with the newest market price of bread, where she answered she will look outside Gensokyo for food! It is unclear how she will accomplish this goal, but if she satisfies her hunger with food from outside Gensokyo, the price of grain can finally calm down!"
 touhou_news.14.t: "NEW INVENTION: DIPLOMATIC DANMAKU FIGHT!"
 touhou_news.14.desc: "\"The years of solitude are finally over!\" were the thoughts of the girl of destruction when she presented her innovative idea to the world! Flandre Scarlet has recently developed a new way of holding Gensokyo's legendary Danmaku Fights: the \"Diplomatic Danmaku Fight\"! Thanks to her newest invention people can finally play together without the fear of hurting each other - and this pleases humans as well as little vampires likewise! This new technique is already used by Marisa, Yukari and Yuyuko, but will this ever replace the normal danmaku? ONLY THE FUTURE WILL TELL!"
 touhou_news.20.t: "BREAKING NEWS: ALIEN VISITS AND FALSE MAPS!"
 touhou_news.20.desc: "It was a peaceful night. There were no signs for an abnormal observation. But then strange red and blue dots were noticed in the night sky! According to experts, they weren't neither danmaku projectiles nor any known Gensokyan flying in the sky! The humans are afraid, the youkai don't get any rest and even here on the Youkai Mountains we tengu haven't been able to keep an eye closed since then. Neither the Hakurei Shrine nor the Witch from the Magic of Forest want to say anything about this event. But the appearance of strange dots in the sky weren't the only curious things that happened to Gensokyo! Cartographers noticed this morning that many known places of Gensokyo have been moved and even a huge river appeared in Gensokyo! HAVE ALIENS ALTERED OUR HOMELAND?! YOU WILL KNOW CONCLUSION IN THE NEXT NEWSPAPER!"
 touhou_news.30.t: "BREAKING NEWS: FAKE MOON! FAKE MOON!"
 touhou_news.30.desc: "It is only a sliver - a little defect in the light. Something that a normal human wouldn't be able to see the difference. But the many local youkai notice this - and this very badly! The Moon, a long friend of our lovely world we call Earth, is FAKE! The light it emits is only an illusion! And the worst thing is: it makes the many weaker youkai of Gensokyo go mad! When the sun sets, the fake moonlight gets mixed with the sunlight, which causes many once so beloved youkai to go insane! There were already reports of rampaging youkai in the Bamboo Forest! IS THIS THE WORK OF ALIENS WHO TRY TO DESTROY GENSOKYO? OR DID DRUNK ONI DESTROY THE MOON AND REPLACED IT WITH A FAKE ONE? BUNBUNMARU NEWS WILL LET YOU KNOW OF THE TRUTH!"
 touhou_news.31.t: "FIRE IN THE BAMBOO FOREST!"
 touhou_news.31.desc: "A massive fire broke out in  the Bamboo forest! Information around this fire is hard to find, but your tengu news team did find them anyway! According to eye and bun witnesses the fire is a product of a fight, which has plagued the Bamboo Forest since an eternity: the war between Kaguya Houraisan, a mysterious yet extremely beautiful lady, and Fujiwara no Mokou, a strange girl who likes to light herself! They've been rivals since both arrived in Gensokyo. Although they both have the highest number of murder attempts at each other, none of them is actually dead! A strange surprise, but a welcome one as Mokou is extremely popular with the other Eientei habitants as well as a good friend with the Human Capital! The Human Capital would suffer a huge loss should Mokou ever die - and our tengu will be the first to let you know if this ever happens!"
 touhou_news.32.t: "MYSTERIES OF THE MOON!"
 touhou_news.32.desc: "Because of the changes in the night sky we asked somebody, who was on the Moon a millennium ago, for information about this mysterious phenomenon in the sky: Yukari Yakumo!\n\"Ms. Yakumo, can you tell us something about the Moon?\"\n\"Sure, Ms. Shameimaru. The Moon is a dangerous and lifeless rock, filled with crazy people, who would like to enslave simple people like you and me.\"\n\"This is worrisome. Do they want to attack us?\"\n\"Currently not, but I wouldn't be surprised if they decide to do so one day. They have a very strong defense, but you shouldn't underestimate their Moon Rabbit soldiers. Although in the Lunarian eyes the most expensive thing of a Rabbit soldier is their weapon, they are still fearsome warriors, who would kill tengu like you without a blink. My advice is to keep your guards on all the time.\"\n\"Those are some really worrisome news. Do you think the change in the sky is a product of those Lunarians, Ms. Yakumo?\"\n\"Possible. I recognize the magic of this and it is Lunarian nature. But why would the Lunarians want to hide themselves from Gensokyo? Well, either way, my good friend Reimu and I will solve this. You have not to worry, little bird.\"\n\"Thank you for your time, Ms. Yakumo.\""
 touhou_news.33.t: "SEVERAL LEADERS ARE ANNOUNCING THEIR FOCUSES!"
 touhou_news.33.desc: "Since the day it was revealed that the maps were wrong, a lot of new clans and nations found their way to the map of Gensokyo! For a long time it was unknown what exactly their ambitions may have been - until today! We just got the message, that all the new leaders have gathered in the neutral Human Capital and announced their ideas, their traditions and especially their ambitions! Special mentions go to a crazed engineer who yelled about \"tanks\" for several hours and the fairies, who decided to try a new life as pirates! What will this bring to Gensokyo? And are fairy pirates the future?! \"Great! Now my freaking mansion will be raided every day!\", complains Remilia Scarlet regarding that news. Experts are unsure how this announcement will change the balance of power in Gensokyo!"
 touhou_news.40.t: "BACK IN BUSINESS - AGAIN!"
 touhou_news.40.desc: "For everyone who has read the first article months ago this title will look quite familiar, but now the newspaper is back! However, this time we have another story, why the newspaper came late: in recent times, we Tengu had internal struggles with some newcomers and disputes about religions - the classic stuff. But the Bunbunmaru News also had some problems with some really, really zealous shrine maidens and their profit oriented goddess. Of course I won't mention names this time too, but be assured: we from the Bunbunmaru News will never put true facts and stories behind profit! With that said that said, have fun with the news of this month and last month!\n - Shameimaru Aya\n\n\n*The next five pages are filled with random advertisement of Kappa inventions, which are definitely built with profit in mind*"
 touhou_news.41.t: "BREAKING NEWS: A NEW SHRINE OPENS!"
 touhou_news.41.desc: "For a very long time only the Hakurei Shrine was the anchor point for spiritual and religious guidance in Gensokyo - and this was true even waaaay back when the Shrine was still located in the North! But this is about to change! The new Moriya Shrine, right next to our humble newspaper production hub, has officially opened and started their campaign to get more followers! However, rumors have arrived that they also want to close Reimu's dearest shrine and eliminate them as their only competition. HOW WILL THE SHRINE MAIDEN REIMU HAKUREI REACT TO THIS AND WILL GENSOKYO FALL INTO A RELIGIOUS TURMOIL? ONLY THE FUTURE MIGHT SHOW THE ANSWERS!"
 touhou_news.42.t: "MORIYA SHRINE PLANS FOR GENSOKYO"
 touhou_news.42.desc: "Speaking of the Moriya Shrine: with their opening they also announced their plans. For this we from the Bunbunmaru News had an interview with their two goddesses: Kanako Yasaka and Suwako Moriya!\nBN: \"Ms. Yasaka-\"\nK:\"Oh, please call me Kanako. I don't like formalities.\"\nS: \"Same here too.\"\nBN: \"Oh, ok. Kanako, can you tell us more about your plans with Gensokyo?\"\nK: \"Sure, Aya. But first some background story: you see, my shrine-\"\nS: *Sarcastic coughing*\nK: \"Excuse me. OUR shrine was originally located in the Outworld. And while we have lost faith as the humans were too busy murdering each other, I have witnessed their technological progression and want to bring it to this lovely land of Gensokyo."\nBN: \"Aha. And what about your religious plans? We heard rumors that you two are trying to reform Gensokyan Shintoism.\"\nS: \"It's actually only Kanako who wants to do this. Personally, I'm just here to see how all of her plans fall apart.\" *laughs*\n K: \"Supportive as ever, Suwako... Anyway, yes, the rumors are true. When we arrived here we saw an extremely wasteful style of Shintoism. All the good faith every god wishes to have just vanishes instead of going to the rightful deity and the main head of this religion doesn't seem to care. So for this we've decided to reform it!\"\nBN: \"I see. Well, sadly the time is over now. I thank you two for your time, Kanako and Suwako.\""
 touhou_news.43.t: "HAKUREI SHRINE REPORTS CRISIS!"
 touhou_news.43.desc: "The Hakurei Shrine - one of the most important places of Gensokyo - can no longer gloss over the numbers: the donation box just doesn't want to be filled! Reimu Hakurei explains, that this is only a temporary problem is, but her shrinemate Suika Ibuki speaks of a curse of the Donation Box!!\nFortunately, they are good news from them: it is said that Reimu and Suika have plans to take care of this financial crisis as well as the new religious threat coming from the new Moriya Shrine as well as the Temples in the North. What will they look like though? We don't know! BUT WE WILL REPORT IT TO YOU AS SOON IT GETS REVEALED!"
 touhou_news.44.t: "SISTER LOST IN FAR WEST!"
 touhou_news.44.desc: "Remilia Scarlet is incredibly worried! Her little sister, Flandre Scarlet, seems to have gone lost ever since Yukari Yakumo paid a visit to the Scarlet Devil Mansion! According to rumors, Yukari gave Flandre the offer to start her own kingdom in the far lands of the West! \"Becoming the Holy Roman Empress is her destiny\" were the words Yukari seemed to have said. ARE THE STORIES TRUE THOUGH? IS A LITTLE VAMPIRE GIRL BECOMING EMPRESS OF AN ENTIRE CONTINENT? ANY FURTHER INFORMATION ONLY HERE AT THE BUNBUNMARU NEWS!"
 touhou_news.45.t: "DEMON ACTIVITIES IN THE NORTH!"
 touhou_news.45.desc: "For a long time they were silent, minding their own business. But lately, more and more stories have come to our ears that the demonic residents of Makai - the very servants of the mysterious goddess Shinki - have become quite active recently. Theories are that Shinki had enough of her losing status in Gensokyo and that she wants to become one of the big players again. Others speculate that she is seeking for a new hobby and started collecting maids. ARE THERE ANY TRUTHS TO THESE THEORIES? WE FROM THE BUNBUNMARU NEWS WILL LET YOU KNOW!"
 touhou_news.50.t: "BREAKING NEWS: DANMAKU EVERYWHERE!!"
 touhou_news.50.desc: "The people of Gensokyo were always very motivated to find reasons to bash the skull of the other person with tons and tons of danmaku, but recently the number of Danmaku Fights has reached an all-time high! Be it humans, fairies, oni, youkai or underpaid shrine maidens: everyone is now challenging the other to a danmaku fight for the silliest reason possible. Even we at the Bunbunmaru News had our fair share of fights too! Fortunately, the newspaper are well protected by our lovable* wolf companions. However, it is only a matter of time until more people want to challenge this reporter to absurd Danmaku Fights! But we will endure for you, dear readers, and print more true and well-written news for you! HOW MANY CHALLENGERS WILL APPEAR IN THE FUTURE THOUGH AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR GENSOKYO? ONLY TIME WILL TELL!\n\n\n*\"Lovable\" is a clear overestimation and should not be used in combination with a wolf tengu."
 touhou_news.51.t: "LOCALE FAIRY DEMANDS JUST-ICE!"
 touhou_news.51.desc: "Cirno has enough! According to the ice fairy of the Misty Lake, the fairies of Gensokyo have suffered enough under foreign invaders and now she demands JUST-ICE! \"No longer shall my kind serve an evil vampire as maidens! No longer shall my fellow fairies be used as cannon fodders by some stupid bakas!!\" - words of an angry ice fairy. Although she shows serious dedication for her cause, we from the Bunbunmaru News remain skeptical if she can enforce her demands. \"Free Pranking\", \"Frogs to freeze for everyone\" and \"Retribution against the evil fairy slayers\" were her promises for every fairy, who wants to join forces with her. WILL CIRNO MANAGE TO CAUSE THE FAIRY REVOLUTION OF GENSOKYO OR WILL SHE SERVE REMILIA AS THE NEW REFRIGERATOR? STAY TUNED FOR MORE INFORMATION IN THE FUTURE!"
 touhou_news.52.t: "PIRACY ON THE MISTY LAKE!"
 touhou_news.52.desc: "Reports of missing ships; kidnapped people; raided coasts! The situation on the Misty Lake is grim! Our reporter Hatate was on site and interviewed the Sakuya Izayoi!\nBN: \"Ms. Sakuya, there have been reports of raided coasts on the Misty Lake. Do you know who could be behind these attacks?\"\nS: \"Ms. Hatate, I must disappoint you, but I do not have an idea who it could be.\"\nBN: \"Could it be somebody from the Scarlet Mansion maybe?\"\nS: \"I beg your pardon, but neither the dear Mistress nor any of her servants is a barbarian. We from the Scarlet Devil Mansion have no connection to these ... savage attacks.\"\nBN: \"Did you hear of any rumors though, which could lead to the culprit?\"\nS: \"Well, the fairy maidens in the mansion speculated that the Three Fairies of Light might be behind these raids. One of them even wished to get unlimited, paid vacations so she can join them. However, we have our doubts that some simple fairies would go so far with their pranks that they operate organized piracy.\"\nBN: \"The fairies have become bolder though - especially after Cirno demanded more rights for fairy kind. What makes you sure that the Three Fairies are not these wanted pirates?\"\nS: \"Ms. Hatate, they are fairies. Even human children at the age of eight have shown a brighter mind than them to say it in a mannered way.\"\nBN: \"I understand. Well then, thank you for your time, Ms. Sakuya.\""
 touhou_news.53.t: "THE DREAMS OF THE YOUNG ONES"
 touhou_news.53.desc: "Not all fairies are mischievous pranksters, who spend their time stealing and freezing. Some of them are actually even quite nice. Enter Lily White and Eternity Larva! We have spent two days observing what these two fairies do in their free time and how they help the people of Gensokyo! First, we accompany the spring fairy Lily White!\n*Two whole pages are filled with a collection of Lily yelling \"Spring has come!\" and how humans see her as a symbol of luck*\nAlthough Lily White is a nice person and is well seen, her day is not all too interesting. HOWEVER: the young fairy Eternity Larva has a more interesting job as well as even a backstory worth to be told! The butterfly fairy Eternity has the ability to change the weather and as such we have observed how she turned even the coldest winter day into a hot summer day! She is also the only fairy who has weird memories of the past! Bad memory is not too uncommon for fairy kind, but Eternity reports that she remembers a great fight against the secret goddess Okina Matara and how she was once somebody else! WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO ETERNITY LARVA IN THE PAST? AND HOW IS OKINA CONNECTED TO THIS STORY? SUBSCRIBE NOW TO BUNBUNMARU NEWS TO READ THE WHOLE STORY!"
 touhou_news.54.t: "HELL FAIRIES? MOON FAIRIES!"
 touhou_news.54.desc: "There is no type of fairies, which is more enveloped in mysteries than the infamous hell fairies. According to fairy experts, this kind of fairies used to live in the Forest of Magic like all the other fairies, but then they got an offer from nobody else than Hecatia Lapislazuli - the Goddess of Hell herself! She offered them power and pranks in exchange for their service. Only a fraction of these fairies joined Hecatia then - included the notorious fairy Clownpiece. Ever since we never heard of these hell fairies again until recently! We got the message from the moon rabbit Reisen Udongein Inaba, who told us that the Lunarians on the Moon are suffering from the natural effect of \"Moon Fairies\". According to Moon expert Eirin, there are no natural fairies on the Moon, but she made the theory that hell fairies could have made their way to the moon and embraced the Lunarian powers there, making them some kind of moon fairies. WILL THESE MOON FAIRIES INVADE GENSOKYO IN THE FUTURE? AND HOW OFTEN WILL WE GET THEM MIXED UP? ONLY TIME WILL TELL!"
 touhou_news.55.t: "DO NOT TOUCH THE SUNFLOWERS!"
 touhou_news.55.desc: "Be wary, child, of the sunflower field\nThe youkai waits and makes your fate sealed\nIf you dare to touch the yellow curse\n\nBe wary, child, of the flower master\nIf you see her run faster and faster\nBefore you can only healed by a nurse\n- Human poem, warning children to go to the Sunflower Fields."
 touhou_news.56.t: "REIMU AND MARISA LAZING AROUND!"
 touhou_news.56.desc: "Outrageous news: despite their promises, neither Reimu nor Marisa are doing ANYTHING! Both of Gensokyo's famous investigators promised that they will put more focus on their goals in Gensokyo, but at the time these news have been brought to you they are just lazing around, saying that \"there wasn't enough time for balancing their focuses\"! For months they talked about their new plans like meditation about the past, forming an own academy for all magicians of Gensokyo, hunting wild youkai down or doing the greatest theft in all time - but nothing! NOTHING! Yukari claims that the works on Reimu's \"mission tree\" needed to be delayed because of missing time for proper \"balancing\" and that the \"developers\" are too busy with \"exams\". Yukari also claims that the next \"update\" include the new changes to Hakurei Clan and the Forest of Magic! We from the Bunbunmaru News have no idea what this gap hag was talking about, but we know one thing for sure: we are offended! WILL YUKARI BE RIGHT THOUGH IN THE END? WE REMAIN SKEPTICAL!"
 touhou_news.60.t: "THE ZUN MYTH"
 touhou_news.60.desc: "Ladies and gentlemen, I am a tengu of reason, logic and facts. As we all know, the Bunbunmaru Newspaper only tells you hard proven facts and truth since our foundation. So if our newspaper has something to say then it is based on knowledge and not on superstitious myths - like the most recent accusations of the existence of a certain god called \"ZUN\". Many, many, *many* youkai and even humans charged into the Bunbunmaru Newspaper office and wished - no, DEMANDED - to give you information about this apparent god ZUN - and all we can say is that: we don't know.\nBUT! As your eager and truth seeking reporter, I promise you to unravel the myth behind it. ARE WE ALL JUST A CREATION OF SOME SUPER GOD EVEN ABOVE OUR OWN? IS THERE ANY TRUTH ABOUT THIS MYTH? AND WHAT DOES REIMU HAKUREI HIDE FROM THE PUBLIC? YOU WILL FIND YOUR ANSWERS ONLY HERE, AT THE BUNBUNMARU NEWS!\n- Aya"
 touhou_news.61.t: "THE SCARLET DEVIL"
 touhou_news.61.desc: "Of all the people, none is more infamous in all of Gensokyo than the vampire from the far west, the Scarlet Devil itself: Remilia Scarlet. Many of us remember the two incidents she caused as well the financial crash of Gensokyan economy when she paid everything she bought with literal gold ingots. Not much is known of her to the public... UNTIL NOW. Remilia proclaimed loudly her goals, which is \"bringing civilization to both Gensokyo and her come continent\". In an interview, she revealed that she needed time to get used to Gensokyo and its traditions in order to learn and expand her influence. Now that she reached this first step, her next one would be a glorious return to the continent she called \"Europe\" in order to \"settle the scores\". We at the Bunbunmaru News interviewed her, but the young vampire remained vague and giggled every five minutes. We are not sure what image to make of it. WHAT COULD REMILIA HAVE MEANT AND WHO ARE THE ONES SHE HAS TO SETTLE THE SCORE? AND WILL THERE BE ANOTHER SCARLET MIST INCIDENT? WE CAN ONLY SPECULATE!"
 touhou_news.62.t: "NEWS FROM FORMER HELL"
 touhou_news.62.desc: "Rumors are spreading that the very mistress of Former Hell, the sinister Satori Komeiji, is planning her own kind of empire building. We tried to interview her, but our field operator's only result was a psychosis caused by the intimidating contact with this powerful mind reader. Hatate will be very missed at the office for the next few weeks, but we must carry on!\nI, your very brave reporter Aya, have been in the blazing hell itself and managed to get an interview with Rin Kaenbyou, the pet of the fearful Satori. However, the discussion partner didn't manage to get any meaningful words out of her mouth except for \"Nyan\". But not all things were for nothing. Through the contact with an oni I should not mention, we learned that Chireiden is planning to unite the hell regions once and for all and even starting their own expeditions in the Outworld. COULD IT BE THAT SATORI WANTS TO REPLACE THE YAMA? AND CAN WE COUNT WITH OUTWORLD GOODS PRODUCED IN THE FLAMES OF HELL ITSELF? LEARN MORE IN OUR NEXT ARTICLE!"
 touhou_news.63.t: "NEW DETECTIVE OFFICE IN FORMER HELL"
 touhou_news.63.desc: "While any information about the plans of Chireiden are futile, we have one thing we can report for sure! Due to the growth of the soul population, Former Hell has received a huge influx of new residents. As such, the crime rate has risen to a catastrophic amount! Entering Former Hell has already been a dangerous undertake, but now it is almost as bad as during the Dark, pre-Danmaku Age of Gensokyo. Fortunately for the people of Former Hell, a new detective has been investigating the several murder and crime cases and single-handily managed to stop huge criminal gangs and activities in the era. We do not know who this is, but we can say for sure that this person is a blessing to an otherwise very cursed region. WHO COULD THIS PERSON BE AND WILL SATORI REALIZE HOW BAD OF A RULER SHE IS? MIGHT THE ANSWER COME SWIFT FOR THE RESIDENT'S SAKE!"
 touhou_news.64.t: "REIMU STARTS OFFICIAL YOUKAI HUNT"
 touhou_news.64.desc: "The times of having an easy life as a youkai are over! Reimu Hakurei, the red shrine maiden and protector of Gensokyo itself, opened the official Youkai Hunting Business. We from the Bunbunmaru News interviewed her for her reasons!\nBN: \"Miss Hakurei, what made you start this business on such a large scale?\"\nReimu: \"Are we really doing this, Aya? You know how much I dislike these interviews of yours. Or your news-\"\nBN: \"Miss Hakurei, we would wish you to remain professional. After all, we are doing this for our readers and they demand knowledge! And you know what happens if you don't comply with them.\"\nR: \"*Sigh* Fine. I opened this business because none of you - not a single one of you readers - bothered to visit the shrine and to give some donations. I am just doing what I can do best and monetize it now.\"\nBN: \"Don't you think going out and murdering peaceful youkai is a little bit cruel, Miss Hakurei?\"\nR: \"Peaceful? Please, tell that to the human victims from these youkai attacks. And anyway, I am not the one who is too bothered with that anyway. After all, it's just a contract for me. Somebody has a problem with youkai. They call me. I exterminate youkai. They pay me in cash. It's that easy. And now leave my shrine. You are getting annoying.\"\nYou have heard it for yourself. REIMU IS MURDERING YOUKAI KIND FOR MONEY! This reporter is disgusted, but intrigued by her prices."
 touhou_news.65.t: "BOOK THEFTS ARE SKYROCKETING"
 touhou_news.65.desc: "Theft is not all too common in Gensokyo - except when you are living near the Forest of Magic. Little girls cry, humans fall into bankruptcy and even the Scarlet Devil Mansion is reporting a net loss of several millions gold pieces. Why? Because of simple book theft! Alice Margatroid, the second in command of managing the forest is fully aware of this issue and points her finger on the fairies for causing so much harm again. After all, it wouldn't be the first time they did something similar to that. But we from the Bunbunmaru News have another theory!\nEver since the reports of book theft have been high enough to even reach the Youkai Mountain, we did our own research - and made a shocking conclusion! The witch and investigator, who is supposed to protect Gensokyo, did all of them! Marisa Kirisame is a book thief who has been breaking into libraries several times. We from the Bunbunmaru News have questions: WHY? AND HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE UNTIL SOMEBODY CAN FINALLY STOP HER? WHO WILL DEFEAT HER AND STOP THIS BOOK MENACE? ONLY TIME WILL TELL!"

 touhou_news.70.desc: "My dear readers, today's main article is dedicated to a very serious topic. In the past few months we, your loyal and truthful Bunbunmaru Newspaper, have always served you, the beloved readers, with the most researched and true news imaginable. Although we are sure most of you are good people, we still received more than a dozen mails claiming that our news is completely made up. You can of course imagine the outrage we had when we read the mails. As your trusted journalist I took these claims very seriously and dug through previous newspapers.\nDespite best attempts, we were not able to find anything supporting these claims. But maybe, this news is fake too? ONLY THE FUTURE WILL TE- hey hey! What are you doing here?!\n - Shameimaru Aya\n\nThe Bunbunmaru Newspaper is going through a series of serious investigations. Until they are over, the new journalist for the news is the Kakashi Spirit News with me, Hatate Himekaidou, as your journalist! I promise you that the next pages are 100% true and are based on facts instead of speculation.\n - Hatate Himekaidou"
 touhou_news.71.t: "Revolts against Shinki"
 touhou_news.71.desc: "The realm of Makai is one of many mysteries and legends. Many Gensokyan doubt of its existence, and those who ventured to this infamous place refuse to give information. Because of that we from the Kakashi Spirit News always had a great interest in what is happening beyond the Barrier of Makai.\nAnd it seems like we had finally luck too! A gate guardian of Makai finally appeared to our journalists and reported what was going on. Apparently, a cult around the goddess Shinki has formed, which is mostly made out of the demonic creations of Shinki. However, the mortals in this realm are facing severe oppression and discrimination. According to trustworthy sources, it is only a matter of time until they revolt against the goddess with all what they have."
 touhou_news.72.t: "Eternal Enemies"
 touhou_news.72.desc: "The story of Kaguya and Mokou is as old as the concept of hatred itself. Two immortal beings, who hate each other's guts for eternities. Most of you, the dear readers, are already aware of these two. Because of that I skip the backstory and jump to our attempt to burry the hatchet for these two stubborn girls.\nHatate: \"Lady Kaguya, Lady Mokou, I hope you two know why I brought you here.\"\nMokou: \"Oh I see, you brought her to me so I can kill this excuse of a princess right now?\"\nKaguya: \"HAH!

 touhou_news.73.t: "Sanae's Crusaders"
 touhou_news.73.desc: "The influence of the Moriya shrine is no secret to anyone in Gensokyo. Especially Reimu Hakurei, the head of the Hakurei Shrine, is feeling the pressure the most as her competitor tries to use the power of technology and faith in order to drive Hakurei Shintoism out of Gensokyo. However, nobody expected Sanae's newest super weapon in her quest for religious dominance: Sanae's Crusaders!\nTrust me, my dear readers, I wish I would make this up. But no, the Moriya Clan has established new laws and traditions, which now allow their followers to accompany them in their crusades against heathens and heretics alike! And it comes worse: after further investigations we have learned that most of Sanae's followers are young men, ill equipped and with no religious intentions whatsoever! Here at the Kakashi Spirit News can only speculate what these men drive to throw their lives away for Sanae, but we will let you know as soon as we find it out!"
 touhou_news.74.t: "Reorganization of Mayohigan Shogunate"
 touhou_news.74.desc: "No other youkai is as influential, infamous, feared and respected as Yukari Yakumo. Quite some time ago, the Bunbunmaru News reported that Yukari was going for her own \"British Empire\", and while her goals - according to the sage herself - have been reached, the internal structure of Mayohiga was not to her liking. At this point I would like to quote the sage herself: \"A big problem of my little empire was that all my loyal subjects murdered each other and grew out of control in territory. Then they started to get the audacity to challenge me, losing any loyalty they ever had to me.\"\n\"Of course this is inacceptable. So Ran and I decided to sit together and planned to rework my own shogunate. After several dozen cups of over-sugared tea, we finally got the perfect plan! We allow the daimyos to grow as previously, but now I lure them into loyalty with the promise of becoming my march. And when they think they have gotten a new promotion the trap will strike. All of their land will be redistributed, and the internal battle royal starts again.\"\nWe asked Yukari if it would be just better to not let the own subjects murder each other, but she only replied with \"That's not what EU4 is for, pretty.\". Yet again Gensokyo is perplexed by this strange lady..."

Are you working for a greedy boss who couldn't give a damn about you and only cares for your service? Did you have enough of working for mortals?\nThen come to Netherworld!

 touhou_news.80.t: "THE STATE OF BUNBUNMARU NEWSPAPER"
 touhou_news.80.desc: "Once the pride of Tengu journalism - now a shadow of its former glory. Everyone who has read the last edition knows what is referred here. For the ones who did not read the last Kakashi Spirit News, here is a short summary: Shameimaru Aya and the Bunbunmaru Newspaper is under investigation due to unjournalistic, deceitful and outright disrespectful conduct in their way of reporting and interviewing.\nBut the investigations have revealed more misbehavior from the Bunbunmaru Newspaper: Apparently, an important source of income for the newspaper was the creation of photos of certain inhabitants of Gensokyo, which can be only described as inappropriate. I will not elaborate further on the nature of the photos in order to keep the newspaper family friendly. If you happened to wear a skirt in the last six months though, and you have a suspicion that your privacy has been violated, then please contact us at the Kakashi Spirit News.\n - Hatate Himekaidou"
 touhou_news.81.t: "Blooming Chaos in Gensokyo"
 touhou_news.81.desc: "The blooming of flowers in Gensokyo is always a highlight of the spring. Fairies are flying everywhere around, enjoying the sunlight and youkai have the time to go inside themselves and live in tranquil. This year blooming is not different to the previous ones - except for one single detail: the pure quantity of flowers has reached a new all time high, and even flowers, which are completely out of season, are blooming. According to trustworthy military reports from the Human Capital, the fairies are going in a literal overdrive. Also, many of the flowers which bloom seem to possess unnatural, dangerous traits. We from the Kakashi Spirit News highly advise to keep your distance from these flowers, and notify a professional shrine maiden to take care of it if one should bloom in your garden!\n\nThe blooming is rumored to be the result of an incident. Others think it IS the incident. Kakashi Spirit News will reveal the truth of you as soon brave investigators have solved the cause for this strange phenomenon."
 touhou_news.82.t: "The Yamaxanadu - The Person behind the Judge"
 touhou_news.82.desc: "The Bunbunmaru Newspaper is currently investigated for several conducts. This has been mentioned in the first article. However, dear reader, do you know who will be the person judging Aya's case? You might probably have heard her name, but it is more likely that you know her title instead: the Yamaxanadu, Supreme Judge of Paradise. Or Eiki Shiki for those who do not want to be bothered with long titles.\nEiki Shiki is not a person of public, but her work is noticeable in all of Gensokyo. She is the one who sends the souls to Heaven, to Netherworld or to Hell. Her most notorious personality trait, however, is that she visits those who are prime candidate for hell, personally in order to give them lectures. Now, I know what you, attentive reader, might think: \"she sounds like an annoying brat\". For these I can only say from what I have experienced in the past. The Yamaxanadu has little to no free time due to her job, yet she goes all the way out in her spare time to sinners in order to notify them that they will end up in hell for their bad behavior. However, she does not torture you with hour long lectures, nor does she hit you with the rod of remorse for small things. Instead, she gives YOU the choice to change your way on your own.\n\nDoes this make her a good person? Is the notification really welcomed? These are questions which only you, dear reader, can answer for yourself."

 touhou_news.83.desc: "A lot of hot geysers popped up in Gensokyo during the last, icy winter. Of course the residents were more than happy to warm themselves in the water of the geysers, but they did not expect the threats of these springs: wild, vengeful earth spirits seem to accompany every geyser we have seen in Gensokyo! After further investigations, we found out that something under the earth is causing these geysers to appear - something very powerful. Our soldier Momiji was tasked with investigating even further, but she quickly got very sick after an encounter with a spider youkai.\nIt is now up to the investigators to resolve this incident and calm the earth down.\n\nAnd we from the Kakashi Spirit News will keep a close eye on our heroes!"
 touhou_news.84.t: "Super Brawl in Former Hell"
 touhou_news.84.desc: "Former Hell has always been a place known for its rather... rough environment. Humans, youkai and fairies alike try to avoid the depths of Former Hell. But sometimes, things manage to get out of the depth of Hell itself. This week, a group of Oni caused a mass brawl in the lands of the Oni Exiles. According to a brief interview with the overlord of the Oni Exilies, Satori Komeiji, a fight broke out between Yuugi Hoshiguma, the leader of the Oni Exiles, and a younger oni. Reason for the brawl of superlatives degree is the young oni's demand for the reconquest of the Youkai Mountain. Yuugi was questioned in her authority, and the young oni and his friends broke their glass to attack Yuugi personally. It went so wild that even the Former Hell's neighbor, Remilia Scarlet, had to make an official complaint about the noise. In the brawl the young oni and his friends were beaten unconscious, while Yuugi received a minor trauma. All of them are currently in the care of doctor Eirin."
 touhou_news.85.t: "The Mysteries of Mima"
 touhou_news.85.desc: "A long time ago, the major civilizations of Gensokyo resided in the high, now forbidden North. Back in these dreadful days, the youkai were much more aggressive and demonic creatures sought others for fights. It was a time without spellcard rules, and as such the death toll was higher than today's Gensokyans could ever imagine.\nHowever, none of the creatures might have as many mysteries and legends about than the vengeful spirit herself: Mima of Reimaden.\nOur sources are scarce, but so much is said to be clear about her: the vengeful spirit Mima is a sorceress of immense power, and is said to be the teacher of the famous witch Marisa Kirisame herself. Tales of Mima also report her unending wish to cause chaos and destruction not only to humans - the prime target of her vengeance - but all who defy her authority. Additionally, according to our sources from Reimu Hakurei, the evil ghost also wishes to recreate a body so she can finally return as a wielder of unforseen magic.\n\nWe have to point out that no story of Mima can be 100% accurate as her very existence is bordering between myth and reality. However, should Mima exist, then we should be prepared for the worst from the North..."

 touhou_news.90.desc: "Greeting and welcome to our newest news from the Kakashi Spirit News. The last update has been a few months ago and we want to apologize for the delay. We tengu had a series of internal troubles for the past six months and our editor in chief has been too busy with a different project. This means the discussions and conflicts were dragging on and on and on and on... - you get the picture. And because nobody could make a compromise with anybody here for the content of the next magazine this edition has been stalled. But fortunately enough, these conflicts have been resolved at once and we are back in business.\nBut enough of Kakashi Spirit News as we got hot information about the Bunbunmaru Newspaper! After a series of investigations, the authorities were not able to find enough evidences to make the charges against Aya and her crew stick. Eventually, the case went cold. The great tengu lord Tenma pronounced his verdict that Aya and her journalist crew are innocent and the Bunbunmaru Newspaper is free to operate as they used to before these accusations. We from the Kakashi Spirit News are outraged to hear this as it is more than clear that the Journalist Shameimaru Aya used--\n\nThe newspaper is cut on this spot, making it impossible to read it to its end. Whatever happened, somebody does not want that Hatate's information gets shared with the public..."

 touhou_news.91.desc: "Hey hey, Aya from the Bunbunmaru Newspaper here! My dear readers, the one or another might be aware of the accusations the Bunbunmaru Newspaper received - mostly related to indecent misconduct and the violation of the private sphere of employees and public figures. We can say with pride that we did a series of investigations of our past behavior and found no evidences of such misbehavior. The tengu and even the miko authorities had to come to this conclusion and dropped any kind of accusation against the Bunbunmaru Newspaper.\nWe are, once again, back in business, dear reader, and I am more than happy to share this information with Gensokyo!\n\nThis edition of the Bunbunmaru Newspaper is completely dedicated to the news related to the tengu, the kappa, the newcomers to Gensokyo and even the moon.

 touhou_news.92.desc: "While the tengu authorities were busy wast... I mean, investing their time in investigating the state of the Bunbunmaru Newspaper, the Low Tengu of Tengu Town have expressed their frustration with the rule of the Great Tengu. Around three days ago, the Great Tengu Megumu visited the town and ordered the increase of newspaper and weapon production by 2000%. Naturally, neither our brothers and sisters of the Crow Tengu nor the over-proud Wolf Tengu were too happy with such demands and started revolting. The situation of the town is tense as the rebellion is going for two days. The leader of the Wolf Tengu caste, Inubashiri Momiji herself, is giving the Low Tengu a motivational speech while the forces of Tenma prepare for the worst. WILL WE SEE THE FIRST TENGU CIVIL WAR IN AEONS?! WE WILL FIND THAT OUT IN THE NEXT EDITION OF BUNBUNMARU NEWSPAPER!"

 touhou_news.93.desc: "The kappa of Gensokyo are well known for the technological finesse and their ability to turn junk into moneymaker. However, their ability to work together with somebody, on the other hand, is high fantasy at best. We from Bunbunmaru Newspaper brought the great leaders of the two larget kappa factions together in an attempt to resolve their conflict:\nBN: \"Ms. Kawashiro, Ms. Yamashiro, it is a pleasure to have you both in the same room.\"\nY: \"The pleasure would be mine if you didn't invite HER to this interview.\"\nK: \"Really? Are we starting to have this kind of conversation 532 nanoseconds into the conversation?\"\nY: \"Of course. Don't you get it? Personality clashes are a real thing. But an emotional *censored* like you wouldn't get it anyway.\"\nK: \"Emotional? Oh really? Who starts throwing here with insults around already?\"\nBN: \"Time out! Time out! You both should-\"\nY: \"Pff as if your opinion is of any value. The Komeiji-Toyosatomimi tests already have shown that a normal and logical discussion cannot work with you anyway.\"\nK: \"What discussion even? You don't even let-\"\nY: \"Shut up. A united kappa was my idea. I am entitled to rule all the kappa and you know it!\"\nK: \"You know what, I have enough. Ms. Shameimaru, if you excuse me, I'm leaving. A kappa unification is not possible as long somebody like Yamashiro exists.\"\n\nAs you might have seen, the kappa are a difficult folk to unify. WILL KAWASHIRO NITORI MANAGE TO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE ANYWAY THOUGH?! LET US SEE AND HOPE FOR THE FUTURE OF THE KAPPA!"

This morning a comet crashed into a farm house in Eientei, destroying the house and scorching the bamboo forest around it. On closer inspection it has been revealed that this comet was not an object from space but an escape pod, used by a lunarian rabbit.\nThe rabbit explained that the mysterious Lunarians are going through several military reforms and conscript every single moon rabbit they can find in their army. According to our moon expert, Reisen Udongein Inaba, this can only mean one thing: invasion. WILL THE LUNARIAN ATTACK GENSOKYO AND TRY TO ERADICATE ALL LIFE OF EARTH?

 touhou_news.95.desc: "There are not many times where new realms are born in Gensokyo. But when they occur, then a whole wave of new nations spring up. This week four new domains declared their existence and got internationally recognized as such.\nIn the depths of hell itself there is the Gouyoku Alliance, led by the everhungry Yuuma Toutetsu. Her goals are beyond what we can find out, but we expect that she has the same ideals and aspiration as her fellow beastial leaders do.\nNext to the alliance, barely in Hell, is the outworld state of the Hifuu Club led by the \"Club President\" Sumireko Usami. She proclaims that she wants to explore Gensokyo and see the wonders of this world.\nNext are the mountain kappas of Yamashiro, a breakaway state of Kappapolis and led by Takane Yamashiro. Though we tried to resolve the conflict Takane and Nitori have, the two kappa states just could not exist within the same perimeter. Whatever has been going on there, Takane seemed to have a grudge against Nitori for some years...\nFinally there is the insignificant state of Houjuu, a vassal state of the Myouren Temple under Nue Houjouu's ... guidance. We from the Bunbunmaru Newspaper have little belief that Nue will be able to shape the fate of Gensokyo, but we shall see...."
