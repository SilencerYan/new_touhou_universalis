 ###INCIDENTS GENERAL EVENTS###
 th_danmaku_event.0.t: "How did you come here?!"
 th_danmaku_event.0.desc: "If you see this event, please let Comrade Flan know that he can't code."
 th_danmaku_event.0.a: "Comrade, you can't code."
 th_danmaku_event.1.t: "Danmaku Fights"
 th_danmaku_event.1.desc: "Because this is your first Incident, I will explain how it works: Incidents are a chain of events, which impact large areas of Gensokyo, your realm and the characters, which are involved in this mess - your ruler is among them. \nDuring the Incident your ruler will make a journey through Gensokyo and encounter special foes: the Stage Bosses from the original Touhou games. To progress the Incident storyline you'll have to find a way to pass these Bosses. The most common way for this is the traditional \"Danmaku Fight\" between your ruler and your opponent. The combat skills of your foe are fixed, but the skills of your ruler are determined by these stats:\n - Military Skill of your ruler * 100\n - Army Tradition * 3\n - Religious Unity * 0.5\n - Tolerance of the True Faith * 100\n - Danmaku Power\n - Multiplied by your Danmaku Power Modifier + 100%\n\nIf your fighting skill outdoes the skill of your opponent, you will most likely win. Victories increase \"points\" for a positive ending of the Incident, while defeats decrease them. The decisions you make in random Incident events affect these points too. When all Stage Bosses are cleared you'll get an ending event and, if the score is high enough, gain a powerful modifier."
 th_danmaku_event.1.a: "Thanks for the information."
 th_danmaku_event.2.t: "Major Victory"
 th_danmaku_event.2.desc: "The fight was short, but glorious nonetheless and your opponent now lies on the ground - unconscious, but not dead. Your path is now free from any obstacle now!"
 th_danmaku_event.2.a: "That was easier than expected."
 th_danmaku_event.2.tt: "This great victory gave you a major bonus for a positive ending of the current Incident."
 th_danmaku_event.3.t: "Victory"
 th_danmaku_event.3.desc: "The fight was long, but it was obvious that you maintained the upper hand the entire time. After a while your opponent was finally defeated."
 th_danmaku_event.3.a: "Well then, one less enemy to worry about."
 th_danmaku_event.3.tt: "This victory gave you a bonus for a positive ending of the current Incident."
 th_danmaku_event.4.t: "Draw"
 th_danmaku_event.4.desc: "The fight was long, hard and sweaty. Neither you nor your opponent could defeat the other. After hours of fighting and shooting danmaku at each other, your opponent acknowledged your strength and let you pass."
 th_danmaku_event.4.a: "I didn't lose. I just decided not to win."
 th_danmaku_event.4.tt: "This draw gave you a minor bonus for a positive ending of the current Incident."
 th_danmaku_event.5.t: "Defeat"
 th_danmaku_event.5.desc: "The fight was long and hard. Regardless of how many danmaku you shot, how often you hit your opponent - you just couldn't defeat them. You retreat from the fight wounded and defeated, but not broken."
 th_danmaku_event.5.a: "This was only a setback."
 th_danmaku_event.5.tt: "This defeat gave you a minor bonus for a negative ending of the current Incident."
 th_danmaku_event.6.t: "Major Defeat"
 th_danmaku_event.6.desc: "Without any signs of life lies your body on the ground. The fight was brutal and it was a miracle you survived so long. But in the end you couldn't stand up to the power of your opponent. Your successor must now continue your path to solve this incident."
 th_danmaku_event.6.a: "*Angry Ghost noises*"
 th_danmaku_event.6.tt: "This major defeat gave you a bonus for a negative ending of the current Incident." 
 th_danmaku_event.7.t: "A little reminder"
 th_danmaku_event.7.desc: "Ok, Apparently I'll have to explain to you the system again: Incidents are a chain of events, which impact large areas of Gensokyo, your realm and the characters, which are involved in this mess - your ruler is among them. \nDuring the Incident your ruler will make a journey through Gensokyo and encounter special foes: the Stage Bosses from the original Touhou games.

Victories increase \"points\" for a positive ending of the Incident, while defeats decrease them. The decisions you make in random Incident events affect these points too. When all Stage Bosses are cleared you'll get an ending event and, if the score is high enough, gain a powerful modifier."
 th_danmaku_event.7.a: "Thanks for the information. Again."
 th_incidents_event.11.t: "Wanted: Investigator for the Incident!"
 th_incidents_event.11.desc: "The effects of the current incident mark the entire land and it is unclear how long it will take until this incident gets solved. One day you come along to a \"Wanted Sign\", but instead of a criminal it is an investigator wanted! It appears that the former investigator may have been killed and the people of Gensokyo don't know who should continue the investigations. Maybe you, [Root.Monarch.GetName], can grab this chance to earn the glory of somebody, who saved Gensokyo from the Incident..."
 th_incidents_event.11.a: "I have my own reasons why I want this incident done. I will be the new investigator!"
 th_incidents_event.11.a.tt: "Your ruler becomes the new investigator and continues to fight the current incident!"
 th_incidents_event.11.b: "I am sorry, but I don't have the time to solve this incident."
 th_incidents_event.11.b.tt: "Your ruler ignores the sign shield and somebody else becomes the investigator.\nNote: you won't get any other chance to become an investigator for the current incident."
 th_incidents_event.16.t: "The End of an Incident"
 th_incidents_event.16.desc: "Incidents are a complicated matter and they do not get resolved every time. Usually, Gensokyo would be stuck in an endless loop of bad events after bad events, but you're lucky to have me! I will end this incident on my own.\nHowever, this will not go unpunished. I know, I know, it is unfair if you didn't even have a chance to finish the incident because the creator messed up with the events, but see it like this: the creator made it to his goal to rework the incidents anyway. I hope you understand it."
 th_incidents_event.16.a: "One could think the incidents would be not so buggy..."
 th_incidents_event.16.a.tt: "Finish the current §YIncident§! with force."
 th_danmaku_event.20.t: "Diplomatically Danmaku Fights"
 th_danmaku_event.20.desc: "Sometimes two friends are arguing with each other or want to do a Danmaku Fight without the threat of anybody getting killed. In those cases the \"Diplomatic Danmaku Fight\", also known as a \"Friendly Danmaku Fight\" or short \"DDF\" or rather \"FDF\", will be used instead of the traditional Danmaku Fight. The \"combat\" skills of your foe are fixed, but the skills of your ruler are determined by these stats:\n - +50 points, because a ruler without SOME diplomatic skills is not a ruler\n - Diplomatic Skill of your ruler * 100\n - Prestige * 3\n - The Number of Subjects * 50\n - Diplomatic Reputation * 100\n - Danmaku Power\n - Multiplied by your Danmaku Power Modifier + 100%\n\nIf your diplomatic skill outdoes the skill of your opponent, you will most likely win. Contrary to the known, normal fights, the DDF cannot cause a death to your participating ruler. However, it is still a Danmaku Fight and as such it can cause heavy environmental damage and the loser must pay the winner and the repair costs.\nDDFs usually don't appear in incidents and are quite unique."
 th_danmaku_event.20.a: "Thanks for the information."
 th_danmaku_event.21.t: "Major Victory"
 th_danmaku_event.21.desc: "It was a short argument and you easily convinced your opponent for your case without the need to shoot any danmaku missiles, which means you get not only the normal winner prize but also the money for the usual repair costs."
 th_danmaku_event.21.a: "And they say Charisma isn't worth skilling."
 th_danmaku_event.22.t: "Victory"
 th_danmaku_event.22.desc: "Your arguments were solid and your missiles hit the mark perfectly. It didn't take long before your opponent capitulated before your diplomatic (and fighting) skills."
 th_danmaku_event.22.a: "Speak soft words and big sticks can bring one far."
 th_danmaku_event.23.t: "Draw"
 th_danmaku_event.23.desc: "A long and grindy argument was going on, but neither one could convince the other one with either the arguments or the missiles. In the end you and your opponent settled for a draw. Luckily your opponent has a little too much money and decided to take over the repair costs."
 th_danmaku_event.23.a: "Well, at least I didn't lose money."
 th_danmaku_event.24.t: "Defeat"
 th_danmaku_event.24.desc: "You tried to convince your opponent, but all of your arguments were baseless and your opponent made a good point. In the end you decided to let the argument be before some missiles fly so you have only to pay your penalty."
 th_danmaku_event.24.a: "My opponent made some good points though."
 th_danmaku_event.25.t: "Major Defeat"
 th_danmaku_event.25.desc: "Your opponents arguments weren't not only better but also at provoking. You get so annoyed by them that you started to shoot danmaku missiles in EVERY direction, causing heavy damage to everything around you. It is clear that this argument didn't go your way - and on top of that you have now to pay those massive repair costs."
 th_danmaku_event.25.a: "Oh come on! An argument with taunting is not fair!"
 th_danmaku_event.26.t: "A little reminder about DDFs"
 th_danmaku_event.26.desc: "It seems you need a little reminder how a Diplomatic Danmaku Fight works. Well, don't worry. They are so rare it is quite normal to forget how they work.\nNow then: The \"Diplomatic Danmaku Fight\", also known as a \"Friendly Danmaku Fight\" or short \"DDF\" or rather \"FDF\", will be used instead of the traditional Danmaku Fight. The \"combat\" skills of your foe are fixed, but the skills of your ruler are determined by these stats:\n - Diplomatic Skill of your ruler * 100\n - Prestige * 3\n - The Number of Subjects * 50\n - Diplomatic Reputation * 100\n - Danmaku Power\n - Multiplied by your Danmaku Power Modifier + 100%\n\nIf your diplomatic skill outdoes the skill of your opponent, you will most likely win.

 ###SCARLET MISTS INCIDENT###
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.1.t: "Scarlet Mists in Gensokyo"
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.1.desc.1: "It is summer and everyone enjoys the beautiful, warm and sunny weather - except for mistress Remilia Scarlet. Because of her sun sensitive skin she has to remain in the great halls of the Scarlet Devil Mansion. But one day she decided that her freedom of movement was limited for too long and she released the Scarlet Mist, a magical red fog, which blocks any sunlight. And even though Remilia will attract many adventurers and self-proclaimed investigators, who seek to stop her, she enjoys every single second of this incident. The eternal, scarlet night is a beautiful sight after all..."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.1.desc.2: "During a peaceful summer in Gensokyo, an unnatural scarlet mist appears without warning and covers much of the land. It is strong enough to block out the sun, causing the affected areas to become dark and cold. The inhabitants of Gensokyo are worried, that the sun might be gone forever and now they are seeking the help of the shrine maiden to end the spreading of this unnatural fog..."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.1.a: "I should investigate the source of this mist and bring the good weather back."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.1.b: "Somebody should take a look at this fog and seal its source."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.1.c: "I should immediately investigate this incident! We need the sun after all..."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.1.d: "I hope this fog will go away eventually."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.1.e: "Adventurers who dare to challenge me? Let the games begin!"
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.2.t: "Rumia, Youkai of the Dusk"
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.2.desc: "The Scarlet Mist seems to have a pattern indicating a direction to the Misty Lake. As you follow this pattern you see in the distance a complete black sphere flying aimlessly - and it just bumps into a tree.\nYou are approaching the crash spot and find a dizzy girl. This girl is Rumia, the youkai of darkness. Rumia doesn't want you to continue your search until she is fed - and she wants to eat you! She doesn't seem that big of a threat though and could just be ignored because of her dizziness, but with her around, there's not enough light to find the way to the lake, so you might as well put an end to her nighttime snack craving."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.2.a: "She's in my way! I'll have to fight her, if I want to find the source of the mist."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.2.a.tt: "§YThis will trigger a fight between Rumia and [Root.Monarch.GetName]!§!\nThe chances for a victory depend on your §YRuler's Military Skill§!, your §YArmy Tradition§!, your §YReligious Unity§! and your §YTolerance of the True Faith§!. §YDanmaku Power§! increases your ruler's power by a fixed amount and §YDanmaku Power Modifier + 100%§! increases your chances percentage.\n\nBe cautious though: even the most powerful warriors can lose the easiest fights! Your ruler is not invincible and can (and will, if the fighting skill is too horrendous) lose!"
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.2.b: "Well, nobody would be mad if some fairies went missing..."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.2.b.tt: "You skip the fight with Rumia but, by the gods, your subjects and every nation around yours will be very disturbed by your actions."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.2.c: "My allies can deal with her."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.2.c.tt: "You will send Rumia to one of your allies to deal with her. While it gives you a minor bonus for a positive ending, your allies won't be too happy with Rumia and you. If you get unlucky this may even backfire..."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.2.d: "She's just a nuisance and will go eventually."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.2.d.tt: "You will try to ignore her presence. She won't harm you, yet she will annoy you and slows your progress down, resulting in a minor malus for a positive ending of the Incident."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.3.t: "Cirno, Ice Fairy of the Lake"
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.3.desc: "After you passed Rumia, you finally managed to reach the Misty Lake. A magical fog completely covers the lake and you have trouble to see through it. Hours have passed on the lake and you become unsure where you are. Suddenly you hear a voice: \"When you lose your way, it's because of the fairies!\"\nYou see two fairies approaching you - a green haired one and a smaller, blue haired one. While the green head doesn't seem to want to bother you, the blue head actively tries to block you on your path.\nHer name is Cirno, \"the Strongest\", and wants you to show who's the boss of this lake. You'll never find the culprit with this obstruction around, so why not brave a hailstorm or two? Her specialty is ice and freezing magic, so she's someone who'd be pretty useful on a hot summer day."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.3.a: "Well, if she's responsible for this fog, I'll have to blow her and her fog away!"
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.3.a.tt: "§YThis will trigger a fight between Cirno and [Root.Monarch.GetName]!§!"
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.3.b: "I don't have time for this! Annoy someone else!"
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.3.b.tt: "You skip the fight and send Cirno in a random direction away from you - with the promise to freeze fun stuff. While it allows you to make progress, you sent her (unfortunately) to your realm, where she creates chaos and results in decreasing your progress. At the end, you will gain a minor bonus for a positive ending (and a lot of frozen frogs in your realm)."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.3.c: "Cirno... just go back to your realm."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.3.c.tt: "You send Cirno back to her realm and as your vassal she obeys. Even though she isn't too happy about the fact that she isn't the boss of the lake anymore."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.3.d: "Ok, listen up you little fairy..."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.3.d.tt: "You try to trick Cirno into dissolving the fog she created..."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.3.d.success: "... and your trick works."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.3.d.fail: "... and your trick fails, because she is too stupid to fall for it."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.3.e: "I will shake Cirno off in the fog."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.3.e.tt: "You try to flee from the annoyance and get stuck even more in the fog. While she won't bother you anymore, you will lose time in the fog. But at least you have time to rethink your ruling strategies..."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.4.t: "Hong Meiling, Chinese Girl"
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.4.desc: "As the fog faded and the path became clear, you eventually reached the center of this Scarlet Mist: a large mansion in the middle on a little island. As you were looking how to enter a house of the scale of a town you encounter a young woman with long red hair in front of a gate. She reveals herself to be the gatekeeper Hong Meiling and the outer door guard of the Scarlet Devil Mansion, and does her job with flair. A youkai wielding rainbow magic and an interesting dash, she stands between you and the center of the mist. But while she takes her job seriously, she also takes a break after some hours."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.4.a: "Well, this Incident can't wait any further. I'll probably have to punch my way through."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.4.a.tt: "§YThis will trigger a fight between Meiling and [Root.Monarch.GetName]!§!"
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.4.d: "At the wish of the Celestial Emperor, I demand you to let me pass!"
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.4.d.tt: "Meiling is skeptical about your demand, but you show her your Celestial Seal. She has never seen nor heard of a Celestial Seal, but she recognizes the symbols on the seal and lets you through nonetheless."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.4.e: "I could sneak past her when she's doing her break again."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.4.e.tt: "You skip the fight and wait for Meiling to take a break. Hours and hours are passing, but finally Meiling takes a nap and you can pass her. But the time you've been waiting and observing her wasn't very productive."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.5.t: "Patchouli Knowledge, the Girl of Knowledge and Shade"
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.5.desc: "After you've passed the gatekeeper, you stumble into a large library. A very good friend you know would fall in love with this place immediately and take all these books. While you grin about the image of said friend with a tower of books in arms, you encounter a devil girl and, while she didn't pose a threat, she did make a lot of noise in your fight with her.\nA few moments later a voice echoes through the library: \"You, the red-white one! There is no rampaging around in my study.\" A woman with long, purple hair and a outfit, which looks more like something you would wear in bed than in a library, approaches you. This woman, Patchouli Knowledge, is the librarian of the Scarlet Devil Mansion. As the guardian of the books in the library, she stops you as you try to find the cause of all this mist. She may be weak in body, but her magic is top-notch."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.5.a: "Let's see how potent her magic skills really are!"
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.5.a.tt: "§YThis will trigger a fight between Patchouli and [Root.Monarch.GetName]!§!"
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.5.b: "Perhaps I can pay my way through with books..."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.5.b.tt: "You give Patchouli a good portion of your saved treasury to fund a bigger library. Although it hurts you to spend so much money, you won't have to deal with Patchouli for the rest of your stay."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.5.c: "I could bring some of her books back. Maybe she will let me through..."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.5.c.tt: "You manage to get some of her \"borrowed\" books and you bring these back to Patchouli. She thanks you very much and teleports you deeper into the mansion."

 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.6.desc: "Hours have passed in these hallways, which seem to be endlessly long. And any door you open leads into another long hallway. As you begin to think you're lost in this mansion you notice some fairies flying around. They are dressed as maids and carry all kinds of cleaning tools. You even witness how two fairies, their sight completely blocked by their large brooms they carry, crash into each other. All of a sudden you hear an angered voice: \"Ah, the cleaning isn't getting anywhere! The mistress will be angry with me!!\" An elegant looking maid with silver hair appears. She is the mysterious chief maid Sakuya Izayoi and looks like a normal human, but don't be fooled: with her astonishing ability to control time and her remarkable skill with knives, she truly is a dangerous opponent - and she won't let any intruder get to her mistress."
 th_scarlet_mists_incident_events.6.a: "I don't think I can talk my way through. I will have to defeat her."

She reveals herself as the master of the house and the vampire Remilia Scarlet. She is the cause of all the Scarlet Mist that has been hanging around Gensokyo. Although she appears young, she is in fact over 500 years of age, and claims to be a descendant of Tepes himself. While her origin may be a lie, her goal to spread the mist is not.

Arriving in the basement you see a little girl with short, blonde hair, red eyes and wings with colorful crystals. She reveals herself as Flandre Scarlet, Remilia's younger sister. Having lived alone in a basement for 495 years, the commotion of recent events drew her attention. Flandre is only 5 years younger than her sister, but possesses far greater power. All alone, deep underground, it's hard to say that this is a blessing rather than a curse. Regardless, she now wants to play danmaku with you and won't hold back."

Suddenly, the music stops and 3 girls appear directly in front of you! Those are the Prismriver Sisters, 3 ghosts - or better known as \"poltergeists\" - who \"live\" in this mansion.

It is one written by the Watatsuki Sisters, distant relatives of Kaguya and the current rulers of the Lunarian Capital. They order that their deserted pet, Reisen Udongein Inaba, shall return to the moon to serve the Lunarian Army! Because of the deep relationship Reisen and Eientei have and the banishment, Kaguya couldn't let this happen and manipulated reality, creating a fake moon in order to hide Gensokyo from the Lunarians. It is a risky plan, but it is the best one Kaguya could come up with..."
 th_eternal_night_incident_events.1.desc.2: "The night would have been like any other normal night. But yet, this night differs: for a normal human there is no difference to see, but the youkai - the youkai not only see it but also feel it: the moon, a source of the needed moonlight, is not the original one! Somebody put an imitation in its place and covered the original moon up! As long as this fake moon stands, the masses of weak youkai have troubles to keep their sanity. It is only a matter of time before they turn feral..."

A girl  in a brown dress appears and tries to block your path. Obviously this bird has no idea that she isn't standing against any human and a random youkai but against a shrine maiden and Yukari Yakumo herself. But she is a bird brain and her hunger for humans makes her blind, so she won't let you go anyways."

It guides you and your magician companion to the human capital. On the way to the human capital, an annoying voice suddenly rings out. It is a girl in a brown dress and sparrow wings - and she is looking for a fight. Especially after she noticed that one of the two witches is a human! Fortunately, she is not very smart and shouldn't be too much of a problem after a serious beat down..."

Thanks to your sharp vampire eyes, you even found a hint of where the incident starter may be hidden: the Human Capital! On your way to the humans you hear an annoying voice, which belongs to an even more annoying looking girl in a brown dress with sparrow wings. She shows great interest in your servant and completely neglects you - until you stated that the human belongs to you and that you demand passage through the forest. Of course, the bird brain doesn't want to understand so you have to use another language for this sparrow..."
 th_eternal_night_incident_events.3.desc.4: "After a few hours of walking through the forest collecting mushrooms, you and your servant Youmu managed to find a pathway and a hint, which directs you to the Human Capital. As you want to continue this path, your servant hears an annoying voice, which tries to sing a song. After a while the voice revealed itself to be Mystia's one, a girl in a brown dress and with sparrow wings. Of course you don't say how bad the song is, but your servant is more direct and calls it accursed - which makes the bird brain a little mad..."

 th_eternal_night_incident_events.3.c.tt: "You burn Mystia's cart down and mock Mystia for how trash her entire existence is. You may be seen as cruel for this and made Mystia cry, but it takes of you one youkai to annoy you."

 th_eternal_night_incident_events.3.f.tt: "You distract Mystia from her goal of blocking you by buying some of her (vegetarian) snacks. The tasty snacks gave you enough energy to recover the lost time."

The humans in the town are uneasy and tell stories and rumors about rampaging youkai outside the capital. You start to engage with the humans in a chat, but suddenly they all leave you and your partner alone.\nThe reason for that eventually appears: the Guardian of the Capital, Keine Kamishirasawa approaches you and asks you if you have to do anything with the fake moon! It seems like she sees you and your partner as youkai invaders, who want to kill the humans! Because of this, she doesn't listen to your words..."

 th_eternal_night_incident_events.4.desc.3: "After some minutes of travel you and your servant Sakuya managed to reach the Human Capital. Although vampires aren't seen in the human village that often, the humans are still ready to talk with you and your servant - at a healthy distance of course. This wariness reminds you that the Scarlet reputation needs some dire improvements...\nAll of a sudden all the humans start to leave you and your servant alone. As you wonder what caused this sudden lack of interest, you hear a voice in the distance. It is Keine Kamishirasawa, the Guardian of the Humans, and she demands you to leave this village in peace before she uses force..."
 th_eternal_night_incident_events.4.desc.4: "The village is lively - even this late in the night and some takeaways are still open! While you enjoy the human cuisine, Youmu investigates and asks the humans about any strange incidents, which are mostly reports of feral youkai outside the Human Capital.\nSuddenly, the investigation comes to a halt as all the humans leave you and Youmu alone with a third person - Keine Kamishirasawa, the Guardian of the Humans! Apparently, she sees you and your peaceful servant as a threat towards the humans and tries now to stop you at all costs!"

As you arrive at the green hell of bamboo you find a familiar face: Reimu Hakurei, your religious rival, made a resting camp and is trying to solve this incident on her own! As a member of the proud Moriya Clan, it is your duty to defeat Reimu and claim this incident for yourself! The faith from this incident will earn you a rightful claim on the Moriya Shrine!"
 th_eternal_night_incident_events.51.desc.2: "After you finally convinced the Half Beast of your good intentions (and that neither you nor your witch partner wants to attack the humans), Keine was much nicer and gave you the next hint: the Bamboo Forest! After a small trip to \"borrow\" some history books from Keine, you and your partner arrive at the edge of the Bamboo Forest. As you approach the uncanny forest, you notice a familiar camp. Apparently, your good friend Reimu Hakurei is here! She comes closer to you and - you get yelled at! It seems like Reimu believes you lengthened the night just to solve this incident! Reimu is more than mad at you and it will take harsher things than nice words to get past her..."
 th_eternal_night_incident_events.51.desc.3: "It took some serious effort (and maybe one or two spell cards to the face), but you finally managed to convince Keine that you, the mighty vampire, really want to help Gensokyo and the humans. Although she still doesn't fully trust your motives, she gives you the next hint for the incident investigation: the Bamboo Forest! You head to the deep green forest, but as you approach the forest's border, you find a resting camp and a familiar shrine maiden! Reimu Hakurei, one of the investigators in the incident you caused, is taking a break. You come closer to her - only to be greeted with a fist you dodge just in time. Reimu seems to still have old grudges because of the Scarlet Mist Incident and now she won't let you pass..."

It didn't take long for you and your partner to reach the forest. As you approach the border of the forest, you find a familiar looking camp. Two tents and some magician supplies are lying around as well as some books. As you come closer to the camp you hear in Marisa's voice a \"Move and I'll shoot!... I messed up. I mean, shoot and I'll move. Right away!\". You talk a little bit with Marisa and apparently she thinks you are the reason why the night is longer than usual. Although, she is right about the night being longer, she seems to get one thing wrong: she thinks you are the incident starter and now wants a duel!"
 th_eternal_night_incident_events.52.desc.2: "After a friendly duel with Keine followed by a little bit of small talk, the Half Beast gave you the next hint for the incident: the Bamboo Forest! Youmu and you approach the forest's border as you notice a small campsite - next to a pile of magical tomes. As you come closer to the books you hear a familiar voice: \"Move and I'll shoot!... I messed up. I mean, shoot and I'll move. Right away!\" It is Marisa Kirisame - and she seems a little bit out of place. Youmu asks her what she is doing there, but the only answer she gets is that how this eternal night you and your partner have caused is going on her nerves. It is obvious she needs a distraction from her youkai hunt - and nothing is better for the nerves than a danmaku fight!"

You notice the large number of rabbits youkai that attack you and your partner. Those annoying beasts go even so far and try to eat your partner, but fortunately they are easy foes and are defeated easily after some good hits with your magic. One rabbit girl was very persistent in annoying you, but she too goes down after a barrage of spell cards and well timed shots with danmaku.\nAfter the endless fighting with feral rabbit youkai, you and your partner find a mansion in the forest. A moon rabbit girl with pink hair stands in front of the mansion entrance! She reveals herself as Reisen Udongein Inaba, the guardian of this mansion and an elite soldier of the Lunarians and she swore to defend her mistress until death!"

But instead of a syringe, she is holding a bow and arrow in her hands - and she looks ready to use those soon! She reveals herself as Eirin Yagokoro, the creator of the fake moon and Lunarian sage! She explains that this fake moon exists purely to keep her mistress Kaguya Houraisan secret from the Lunarian and keep the Lunarian threat away from Gensokyo! Although her deeds are noble, the Fake Moon is still a massive threat for Gensokyo and its youkai - way more than any immediate threat posed by Lunarian forces!

On your path, Eirin reappears and tries to hinder your progress, but because she is completely caught off guard, the fight with her was an ease for you. As you reach the end of the path, you find a beautiful girl with long, black hair. She reveals herself as Kaguya Houraisan, the mistress of the mansion and master of the Bamboo Forest!
