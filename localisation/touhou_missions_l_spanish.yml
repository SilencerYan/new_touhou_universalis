However, the Fairies always had their fair share of conflicts and disputes - just like those we had with our rivals in the north.\nBut this has to change!

 CIN_defeat_kasha_title: "Defeat the Kasha"
 CIN_defeat_kasha_desc: "The kasha Rin Kaenbyou is responsible for collecting all the corpses in Gensokyo. While her role to keep the land clean is admirable, her methods are however unacceptable: she transforms normal fairies into zombie fairies and command them for her will!

 CIN_unite_sunflower_fairies_desc: "Yuuka Kazami is well known for her beautiful sunflower fields. But one youkai, even one so powerful as Yuuka, can't possibly maintain the sunflower plains alone.

 CIN_vengeance_for_the_fairies_title: "Fairy Vengeance"
 CIN_vengeance_for_the_fairies_desc: "We fairies got suppressed for too long, but now, after we got our own freedom back, it is time to not only liberate other fairies but also to get revenge on all the oppressors! We will not stop until all of Gensokyo is in the hands of the fairies!"

 CIN_queen_cirno_title: "Fairy Royalty"
 CIN_queen_cirno_desc: "Some fairies called our glorious [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] a barbarian and the people of [Root.GetName] as savages. [Root.Monarch.GetName] \"lacks the finesse to be a [Root.GetMonarchTitle]\". Usually our good [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] would ignore the claims of such idiots, but the amount of fairies making the same claims is increasing!

We have to march into the land of the frogs and punish her again!"
 CIN_conquer_okina_title: "Save Fairies from Okina!"
 CIN_conquer_okina_desc: "According to Larva, just at our northern border there lives Okina, a goddess of secrets. Nothing to worry about actually... if it wasn't for the fact that she turns fairies to stone! This has to be stopped immediately - and for this Okina shall pay!"

 CIN_clownpieces_legacy_desc: "Some years ago the goddess Hecatia visited the Forest and asked if any fairy would like to gain power beyond their imagination. Of course only a handful of fairies accepted this offer - and it was nobody else than Cirno's rival Clownpiece and her mates!\nWe didn't hear anything from Clownpiece ever since until recently a fairy from Eientei came to Cirno and told her about the expedition to the moon. Apparently, Clownpiece worked for bringing nature to this place, but it is said she troubles.\nEven though Cirno and Clownpiece are rivals, it is still our duty to help fairies in danger!

 CIN_mission_form_the_fairy_navy_desc: "The goal of our realm is the safety and liberation of all the fairies of Gensokyo! But we know there is more to this world than just Gensokyo!

 CIN_mission_break_the_barrier_title: "Beyond Gensokyo"
 CIN_mission_break_the_barrier_desc: "We knew it! Gensokyo isn't everything! There is indeed an Outworld filled with completely different humans and creatures! We have to explore even further and see what else exists to be discovered!"

 CIN_fairy_curiosity_tt: "Discover any province of Africa."
 CIN_mission_discover_europe_title: "Discover Europe"
 CIN_mission_discover_europe_desc: "The humans always speculated about a rich continent in the far west. If the stories are true we could build a massive empire there, befriend one of the mighty realms, or even escape Gensokyo and start a new life there. The opportunities are endless, but only if we discover this \"Europe\" first."
 CIN_kill_the_ghost_samurai_title: "Defeat the fairy Slayer"
 CIN_kill_the_ghost_samurai_desc: "Although we Fairies are immortal and we get revived every time we die, the pain still remains. Especially the pain coming from sharp katanas and cold, evil ghosts attacks! Youmu Konpaku did many crimes against the Fairy Kind and now she shall feel this pain when her home will become our subject!"
 CIN_learn_from_keine_title: "Learn from Keine"
 CIN_learn_from_keine_desc: "Keine is the protector of humans and their capital, but she also serves Gensokyo as a teacher. While Cirno is already a smart fairy, even she recognizes that some classes from Keine will only strengthen her smartness!"

 CIN_learn_from_eirin_desc: "A goddess from the moon lives in the Bamboo Forest. Her name is Eirin Yagokoro and she is the doctor of Gensokyo ... and a legendary potion maker!

 CIN_learn_from_eiki_title: "Eiki's Lectures"
 CIN_learn_from_eiki_desc: "Even though Cirno is already the wisest fairy in [Root.GetName], sometimes even she has to hear out what another wise person has to say. Eiki Shiki, the Yamaxanadu of Gensokyo, has not very popular lectures, but if Cirno wants to remain the strongest even she has to hear Eiki out."
 CIN_council_of_nine_mission_title: "Team Nine"
 CIN_council_of_nine_mission_desc: "Quite some time ago Cirno was the leader of an \"Elite Special Force Team\". She called it \"Team Nine\" as reference to the Holy Number of the Fairies. However, the team dissolved due to the political turmoils in Gensokyo. But now, Cirno is ruler of a growing fairy realm and with that the power of Team Nine is required again!\nAll what has to be done is making sure that Daiyousei is having her rightful reward, convincing Rumia to return, buying Mystia's shop off and help Wriggle out. After that Team Nine should return to the former glory!"

 CIN_increase_unity_of_team_nine_title: "A More United Team Nine"
 CIN_increase_unity_of_team_nine_desc: "Team nine used to be regarded as a ragtag bunch of weaklings, perhaps many strong youkais and humans still hold this view, but the truth is team nine has governed the country for over 30 years and lead the country to a greater height! We will show those arrogant youkais and humans the strength of a more united and more experienced team nine!"

 CIN_find_letty_desc: "There are only a few others who could rival with the freezing powers of Cirno. One of them is Letty Whiterock, a yuki-onna - also known as winter youkai.

We need to find her so she can teach Cirno some of her powers!\nThank goodness that Cirno's pranks a perfect way to look through the different provinces to find Letty."

 ###MISSIONS FOR MHG###
 MHG_improve_relations_with_yuyuko_title: "An old friendship"
 MHG_improve_relations_with_yuyuko_desc: "Yuyuko and I are best friends for a very long time. We witnessed many strange and wondrous things and we help each other without hesitation. It is good to see her too in this little game. Could you do me a favor and improve relations between her state and ours? This would be wonderful."
 MHG_zashiki_espionage_title: "Zashiki-Warashi"
 MHG_zashiki_espionage_desc: "You'll notice that we have diplomats to inform our neighbors what our goals are. But instead of some boring, ancient men in awkward suits our diplomats are Zashiki-Warashis. These little, childlike youkai are excellent heralds and spies and because of their appearance nobody can be really mad at them. But I didn't use them for espionage missions for a long time and they may be a little rusty now. We should train there spy skills again... and I already know exactly who would be a good target."
 MHG_vassalize_reimu_title: "Subjugate Reimu"
 MHG_vassalize_reimu_desc: "The Hakurei Clan and I have a long history together. I created Gensokyo and the Hakurei Barrier (ok, of course I wasn't quite alone when it was created, but still) and the Hakurei dynasty swore to protect Gensokyo and the Barrier from all intruders. Well, the plot demands that this barrier is for whatever reason gone now and that the young shrine maiden wishes to repair it.\nReimu has the right idea, but without my help she will never be able to repair the barrier in this game. But she won't accept my help, which is why you have to show her our helpful ways by force."
 MHG_vassalize_marisa_title: "Subjugate Marisa"
 MHG_vassalize_marisa_desc: "To the north of Mayohiga lives the little witch Marisa. Personally, I don't really care that much about her, but she is quite powerful ... and she has borrowed some of my stuff!\nNow, I don't really mind her stealing from me - I just can take it back with a simple gap - but I like to have her as a bodyguard. Now then, would you capture the little witch for me now?"
 MHG_humilate_the_devil_title: "Remind our little devil"
 MHG_humilate_the_devil_desc: "To the west of our purple blob we find a scarlet blob. It is unsurprisingly the blob of our little, cute vampire girl. Remilia always liked to make a big fuss and even here in this game she makes things exciting.\nUsually I couldn't care less about her, I mean, I brought her to Gensokyo to start the Scarlet Incident in the first place. One or two incidents would make life more interesting here. Later I noticed this girl has some kind of rivalry with me though and she started to annoy me with her pesky Scarlet Mist.\nAfter the incident is solved we should pay her a little visit, little human."
 MHG_humilate_the_devil_no_inci: "Incidents are deactived."
 MHG_eliminate_the_lunarian_title: "Eliminate the Lunarian"
 MHG_eliminate_the_lunarian_desc: "Ok, listen up, human. This mission here is personal. You certainly noticed the Bamboo Forest with the name \"Eientei\", right? I want you to remove this from the map! I don't want to see this anywhere near my beloved purple blob, did you hear me?"
 MHG_restore_the_hakurei_barrier_title: "Restoration of the Barrier"
 MHG_restore_the_hakurei_barrier_desc: "\"Restoration\" is not the right word though. In this strategy game a continent wide barrier cannot be really represented. To hell, it can't even represent the Great Wall of China properly.\n\nRegardless, to \"restore\" the barrier I want you to protect Gensokyo from any non-Gensokyan intruders. Oh, and a lot of money, some good reputation, a little bit of prestige and one or two gifts from my Outworld friends would be nice too."
 MHG_restore_the_hakurei_barrier_blessings_from_friends: "Has at least one gift from an Outworld friend. These gifts are given to you, if you complete one of the four Outworld mission lines."
 MHG_take_control_over_gensokyo_title: "Diplomacy in Gensokyo"
 MHG_take_control_over_gensokyo_desc: "Now that we have \"restored\" the barrier it is time to spread these news! Of course we could ask Aya to write our achievement in the newspaper, but I don't want to be portrayed as the \"gap hag\" again... No, WE will tell them instead. Or rather YOU will, human. Send our diplomats to Gensokyo's important places. I want that everybody to know, that I am still Gensokyo's guardian!"
 MHG_take_control_over_gensokyo_tooltip: "For the following provinces: Hakurei Shrine, Scarlet Devil Mansion, Chireiden, Eientei, Human Capital, Tengu Capital, Moriya Shrine, Saigyou Ayakashi and Yama's Palace\nThe owner of each provinces has at least an opinion of 100 of us, is our subject or the owner is us."
 MHG_found_the_yakumo_navy_title: "Yakumo Navy"
 MHG_found_the_yakumo_navy_desc: "Do I see it right? This game has ships? Like real ships and not girls cosplaying as ships? I already like this game a lot! Hey, human, found a proper navy please. It is time to create an empire..."
 MHG_map_out_indochina_title: "Map out Indochina"
 MHG_map_out_indochina_desc: "We now have a neat navy, but for some reason we can't use it to get past the \"Terra Incognita\", although I already know all these locations. I guess I don't have full map vision because of balance reasons. Fortunately Chen is an adventures shikigami and can explore the sea for us. You should send her to Indochina first."
 MHG_settle_in_the_phillipines_title: "Colonize the Philippines"
 MHG_settle_in_the_phillipines_desc: "Alright, now we should make our first small step outside of Gensokyo. I made some thoughts about how my blob should expand and I decided for a more \"peaceful\" way. Unfortunately, absolute peaceful is not possible here, but this shouldn't bother us too much.\nI like the idea of having a large, global trade empire while I leave Gensokyo mostly untouched. Of course you, the player and my partner in crime, could decide for another expansion way, but I prefer some good old colonization - started with the Philippines."
 MHG_increase_influence_in_spice_trading_title: "Increase our influence!"
 MHG_increase_influence_in_spice_trading_desc: "So, we have now good foothold on the Philippines. This should allow you to make our next step easier. You see, in this game there's no proper Sphere of Influence which would be more fitting for me. But that doesn't mean we cannot radiate any influence at all - for example through trade. I want you to spread the influence of my realm in the rich areas of the spice islands. I don't care how. You can conquer this puny humans, colonize the empty provinces or send so much more boats than the British Empire ever had in its entire existence."
 MHG_found_the_yakumo_embassy_title: "Mayohiga Embassy"
 MHG_found_the_yakumo_embassy_desc: "You know what? We could use a beautiful embassy. Our country is exploring and expanding into the Outworld and while doing this we will encounter foreign, rich nations. An embassy would not only be useful for diplomacy but it also would make our capital to an important trading city. But to realize such a project we will need some internal stability or else the fairies will never be finished with the building.\n\nAnd no, I won't borrow a large building and make this to an embassy. The last time I did it I transported a large building to Gensokyo I got so tired that I nearly overslept an important incident..."
 MHG_travel_eastwards_title: "Travel eastwards"
 MHG_travel_eastwards_desc: "Besides Australia the Pacific Ocean doesn't have much land to settle. I recommend that you send our explorers eastwards. I promise it will be worth it to search for the new world."
 mhg_discover_american_colonial_regions.tooltip: "Discover the north American west coast."
 MHG_colonize_north_america_title: "Colonize North America"
 MHG_colonize_north_america_desc: "Alright, we have found our new world to exploit its resources. We should immediately start to colonize this land. I personally recommend you to colonize the Mexican region, because it has tons of gold resources AND it has been even confirmed by my lovely conquistador Chen. Good shikigami. She will get some head petting for this...\nWould you kindly colonize Mexico? That would be great."
 MHG_colonize_north_america.tooltip: "Own or have a subject own 5 provinces in either the colonial regions of California, Mexico or Cascadia."
 MHG_subjugate_the_aztecs_title: "Subjugate the Aztecs"
 MHG_subjugate_the_aztecs_desc: "The resources our colonies gather are nice and all, but the true wealth of the new world is guarded by a funny trib... ehh, I mean an empire called the \"Aztecs\". For me at least they are funny. I mean they actively wage wars so they can capture as many humans as possible to sacrifice them to their gods.\nWhat's the matter? Aren't you appealed of human hunting so you have some sacrifices? You know what? I think we could make their sacrifices a little bit more meaningful if we subjugate this pesky empire and force them the Gensokyan faith, so if they kill some people they will at least do it in my name. So let's get started with the conquest..."
 MHG_meet_the_pagan_gods_title: "Meeting with an old friend"

I don't know nor do I care what her plan is. It is important to bring her AND her silk back.\nSpeaking of which: I want her moon silk, because it isn't your usual fabric. It is an alien material, which doesn't exist outside this game, but it has the ability to create gaps and is highly anti-magical.

This is why I helped her.)\nRegardless, she was very thankful for this and promised if there should be no legitimate pharaoh I should get the Egyptian throne.\nBut I never got the opportunity to claim the throne because... weeell, she and her roman lover got a child (who was illegitimate, but whatever).

A lot of intelligent and strong men tried to solve this Knot, but nobody was able to do so. Well... except for one: Alexander. As he stood before this knot, drew his sword and cut the knot in half.\n\"But what has this to do with you?\" you may ask. You see, this oracle was a youkai, who made with me a bet that no human would solve it.

And here comes our grey blob in play: I hire Prussian soldiers and teleport them to our country, so they can serve us (ignore their description as \"Fairy\", this is just show). In return Prussia gains militaristic experience and some well earned money.\nNow to our problem: the teleportation via my gap is intense for the soldiers and they lose a good part of sanity (if you finished the Aztecs mission you will know what I mean) resulting them being less disciplined than your usual Prussian.

You became \"\"\"enlightened\"\"\" (well, as enlightened a human could be that is) and as such ceased to believe in said creatures, the youkai. Well, that was not good for our kind so the sages of Gensokyo formed a group and created the Hakurei Barrier, closing a part of Japan off from the rest of the world, where the youkai can live in peace.\n\nI suppose you have noticed two key points here though: first, I was talking about the industrialization while here in fact you are still in like the Age of Discovery. Secondly, I noted a \"part of Japan\", and, well, your Gensokyo is considerably larger. Please don't let your immersion be ruined by this contradiction.

That would be very nice of you, human.\nYou will need to gather any kind of metal as they will serve as catalysts for the border creation.

During her questioning Meira mentioned a mysterious vanishing of shrine maiden from these lands and that she might know if anyone passed by. No matter how long Meira was searching for Hakurei power, she just couldn't find any clue how to obtain it. It seems we have to go look for the other 3 intruders, they surely may know something. We shall start with a vengeful spirit Mima. Also looking for Alice's traces in nearby realms would be helpful."

Apart from it, Mima's beloved pupil Marisa didn't have any contact with her former master, pretty much like our Alice.

Though it seems its owner nowadays prefers to spend more of her time among sunflowers, she seems to be the same person from before. Yuuka was a little surprised to meet our mistress under these circumstances and apparently she denied any accusations of plundering our realm. Still she did make remarks about the person we are interested in. A seven-colored puppeteer, our Alice. She seems to live now deep in a Forest of Magic in her own realm, alongside with another acquaintance witch Marisa Kirisame. Though at first we need to travel through the human lands where the local population may be quite unfriendly towards demons, youkai and humans alike.

 MRY_suwakos_mishaguji_tt: "At least 8 provinces in the §YNorthern Moriya Lands§!, §YSouthern Moriya Lands§! and §YMoriya Coast§! have §Y20 development§!."
 MRY_eikis_approval_title: "Eiki's Approval"
 MRY_eikis_approval_desc: "Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu, is the judge of Gensokyo and sends the souls according to the Hakurei Shintoistic ways. While what kind of religion she has to base her judgment on is trivial to her (as she always judges the purity of the soul anyways), it plays a huge role for the people of Gensokyo. We will show our superiority when we manage to get the judge of the dead to approve our ways!"
 MRY_eikis_approval_tt: "The reward is depending on how our relationship is with Eiki. If we go the diplomatic way our reward will be more appealing for diplomacy while conquest rewards us with military power."
 MRY_hkr_tradition_title: "Overtake the Traditions"
 MRY_hkr_tradition_desc: "Hakurei Shintoism is an old religion in Gensokyo, but it's not the oldest. Long before there was a way of Shintoism, which was even more savage without any danmaku rules than the Hakurei heretics. We should tell those old-timers that the future is now."
 MRY_religious_domination_title: "Religious Domination"
 MRY_religious_domination_desc: "Gensokyo and its faiths is ours! The heretic beliefs are shattered and about to see their wrongs! From this day forward our religion will be the one deciding the fate of Gensokyo and, in a way, this of the world!"
 mry_moriya_shinto_alliances_tt: "[Root.GetName] must have at least §Y3 [Root.Religion.GetName] Allies§!."

 MRY_create_an_empire_title: "A Kochiya Empire"
 MRY_create_an_empire_desc: "Our realm is a powerhouse regarding the acts of conversion and hunt for youkai, but the world is huge and shrines won't protect Gensokyo from its inner and outer threats. Luckily, Gensokyo has us, but if we want others to acknowledge our role we have to claim the title of an empire!"
 MRY_the_moriya_clergy_title: "The Shrine Clergy"
 MRY_the_moriya_clergy_desc: "Unlike other realms in Gensokyo our clergy is represented by two groups within: the executive shrine maidens led by Sanae and the clergy ruled by Suwako and Kanako. While the shrine maidens govern the realm the power of religious questions is in the shrine clergy's hands. In recent times they lost power due to fighting between Kanako and Suwako. We should re-establish their power again."
 MRY_the_moriya_clergy_tt: "Has at least §Y4§! ideas from §YReligious Ideas§! or any §YIdeas Group related to [Root.Religion.GetName]§! unlocked."
 th_enables_conversion_privilege: "Enables the §YForce Conversion Privilege§!."
 MRY_control_over_the_holy_sites_title: "Control over the Holy Sites"
 MRY_control_over_the_holy_sites_desc: "Gensokyo has many places of great importance and although the Moriya Shintoistic ways don't have any holy sites, those places still are key positions. We should add those places to our sphere of influence and make them to proper shrines for our shrine clergy."
 MRY_control_over_the_holy_sites_tt: "At least §Y5 Holy Sites§! are active for Moriya Shinto."
 MRY_human_world_title: "Convert the Humans"
 MRY_human_world_desc: "The goal of our conversions is not only to bring people to the true cause, but also to gather their faith. And while youkai bring a fair amount of faith to Kanako, their contributions are peanuts compared to the faith humans bring. Sadly, the closest human settlements in our area serve hell and don't bring much faith. However, the humans from the Human Capital are a lot more profitable. It would be wise to convert these lost souls and collect their faith."
 mry_make_hmc_to_religious_tributary_tt: "If §Y[HMC.GetName]§! follows our religion, is independent and is below 200 development they will become our §YReligious Tributary§!.\nShould [HMC.GetName] have more than §Y200 development§!, §Yremain heretic§!, §Ynot exist§! or a §Ysubject§! our capital province will be developed instead."
 MRY_discover_europe_title: "Discover Europe"
 MRY_discover_europe_desc: "Even back in Japan, they were just a myth - the Europeans from the far west with their uncivilized kingdoms and heathen beliefs. Beliefs, which gather faith, should actually belong to us! Our explorers should look for this Europe and report us about these weird, heathen lands."
 MRY_organize_kappa_inventors_title: "Organize the Kappa"
 MRY_organize_kappa_inventors_desc: "Kanako has great plans for Gensokyo and the lifestyle on this land, but for this we need engineers, inventors and builders. Fortunately, our close neighbors, the kappa, are what we need. However, their skills truly shine as a team - which they cannot really organize by themselves. If we really want to use their full potential for our goals we will have to organize their people for them."
 MRY_organize_influence_the_underworld_title: "Influence the Underworld"
 MRY_organize_influence_the_underworld_desc: "Goddess Kanako Yasaka has a vision to revolutionize the economy, society and technology of Gensokyo. For this she gave a hell bird great power to develop a new way of gaining energy. However, due to the unpredictable nature of the bird brain as well as the location of former hell, Kanako has no way to get the results of this project.\nIf we want to support her we will have to spread our influence in Former Hell one way or another."
 mry_mission_to_not_moriya_tt: "Every province in §YFormer Hell§! that is owned by a [Root.Religion.GetName] country but not itself [Root.Religion.GetName] will gain the §YMoriya Shrine Maidens§! modifier for §Y20 years§!, which gives the following effects:\nLocal Missionary Maintenance Cost: §G-25.0%§!\nLocal Missionary Strength: §G+3.0%§!\nLocal Unrest: §G-3§!\n"

 MRY_new_magic_resources_desc: "While we are active in Gensokyo, rumors of a magical \"black gold\" have appeared from the west. Coal - that's the name the Europeans gave it. Luckily, this stone can be found in Gensokyo too. We should ensure an easy access to this magical resource for our purposes."
 MRY_modernize_gensokyo_title: "The Industrial Revolution"
 MRY_modernize_gensokyo_desc: "It is time. All is set up for Kanako's ascendance from a wind and rain goddess into a goddess of technological innovation. All that is left to do is to embrace Industrialization."
 MRY_form_the_moriya_navy_title: "Form the Moriya Navy"
 MRY_form_the_moriya_navy_desc: "The Hakurei Barrier has always been slightly broken - or else our realm wouldn't be in Gensokyo in the first place. But in recent times the cracks of the barrier have become far greater than ever before. It is obvious that the time of Gensokyan Isolation is over! We should build quickly a navy to be prepared for the Outworld."
 MRY_establish_naval_supply_title: "Establish Naval Supply"
 MRY_establish_naval_supply_desc: "While having a fleet is great and all we are lacking in ports to really supply them. Fortunately, our heretic neighbors to the west may lack faith, but they have a lot of coastlines ready to become ours."
 MRY_beyond_the_barrier_title: "Beyond the Barrier"
 MRY_beyond_the_barrier_desc: "The Hakurei Barrier is no more. Gensokyo is free to the Outworld. Many Gensokyan fear for the worst, but for us it means opportunities. Our ships should scout out the oceans to see how the current position and our place in this world look like."
 MRY_back_to_japan_title: "Back to Japan"
 MRY_back_to_japan_desc: "Japan is the land of our origin. It was these islands where Kanako and Suwako fought with their kingdoms against each other - the home of our Shrine Maiden Sanae Kochiya, a place of our heritage. Now it's a place of heretic Shintoism and civil wars with no ends. It is time for us to return and bring peace back to our ancient home."
 MRY_convert_japan_title: "Convert Japan"
 MRY_convert_japan_desc: "The history of Gensokyo is relatively young. Originally most of the inhabitants and even our religion are from our neighbor Japan, a country split in many small realms like ours. Much time has passed since then and the Japanese Shintoism and the Gensokyan Shintoism are now two completely different religions. Yet, if we show them the 'new' form of Shintoism, our Shintoism, they could save themselves from their heresy."
 MRY_enlighten_korea_title: "Convert Korea"
 MRY_enlighten_korea_desc: "With the conversion of the heart of Japan our religious influence in Asia grew immensely. But we are not done yet! The Koreans follow the old way of Confucian, which has many old and useful traditions and mindsets, but it is also outdated. We need to help them so they can follow the way to fortune too!"
 MRY_challenge_the_dragon_title: "Challenge the Dragon"
 MRY_challenge_the_dragon_desc: "Confucianism is an interesting religion: it promotes humanistic ideas and tolerance and it is filled with ancient traditions. But it can also become a danger for any realm, because of these ideas and traditions, the state gets slowed down and can't make fast decisions. This problem is currently the cause of the Celestial Empire's fighting. They are slowed in their actions, yet they are still holding on their outdated mindsets. We should challenge them and save them from themselves!"
 MRY_shinto_unites_far_eastern_asia_title: "Religious Unification"
 MRY_shinto_unites_far_eastern_asia_desc: "In the history of Asia, China, Korea and Japan have never had a good relation with each other and wars between these were more common than it should be. But with the unification of these countries under one, wholesome religion the conflicts may finally stop."
 MRY_religious_prestige_title: "Moriya Prestige"
 MRY_religious_prestige_desc: "Our clan and our religion are relatively young in Gensokyo, and as such we do not have the respect of this world yet. We should change this and gather the prestige which is our birth right!"
 MRY_religious_treasury_title: "Invest in the Shrine"
 MRY_religious_treasury_desc: "Our dear goddess, Yasaka Kanako, noted that the Moriya Shrine, while being at the perfect location, is nowhere near to be ready for mass visit. She recommends a great investment into the shrine first in order to deal with the many pilgrims the goddess is anticipating."
 MRY_danmaku_barracks_title: "Danmaku Training Fields"
 MRY_danmaku_barracks_desc: "The Moriya Clan arrived in Gensokyo in peace. However, Gensokyo is very much not in the mood for it - youkai race to arms, vampires are trying to conquer the south and a heretic goddess in the north expands her influence. If we want to survive in this harsh environment we will need troops and proper training in the arts of Danmaku fights. Additional Danmaku training fields will be required though."
 MRY_danmaku_fights_title: "Fight the Leaders"
 MRY_danmaku_fights_desc: "Having a huge army fighting wars for one is one way to solve conflict, but it is not the only one. Our good shrine maiden Sanae needs to learn how to fight on a personal level. It would be best if she practices it against the other danmaku masters in Gensokyo"
 MRY_reform_the_shrine_title: "Enact Shrine Laws"
 MRY_reform_the_shrine_desc: "The Moriya Clan is yet only a shrine theocracy. Many advanced laws and reforms are still ahead of us; many new ways of gathering faith are yet to be discovered. We should advance the reforms of our government and enact the necessary laws to make faith collection as efficient as possible."
 MRY_mof_incident_title: "Mountain of Faith"
 MRY_mof_incident_desc: "The 'Mountain of Faith' incident - that's how our story will be called in the history books of Gensokyo. It was a time of religious tumolts, movements of reformations and new techniques for conversions."
 MRY_moriya_dominance_title: "The Faith Tributaries"
 MRY_moriya_dominance_desc: "Kanako and Suwako demand for faith is ever growing, and our usage of faith power has reached new records. We should create more religious tributaries who donate faith and money in exchange for protection!"
 MRY_espionage_title: "Spies of Kanako"
 MRY_espionage_desc: "Our goddess Kanako Yasaka is a deity of warfare. What is less known of her is that she plans to expand her influence way beyond just faith, technology and warfare. She observed the sage Yukari Yakumo and her Zashiki-Warashi, and wishes now for agency of her own.\nWe should train a few selected shrine maidens in the art of espionage for our goddess!"
 MRY_moriya_festival_title: "Wonders of a New World"
 MRY_moriya_festival_desc: "While Kanako enjoys using the shrine spies to her liking, the other goddess Suwako Moriya wishes for something out of the ordinary: the preparations to discover a world which is even more foreign than Gensokyo is to us. A \"New World\" in the west.\nOr at least she wishes us to have this possibility to go after it. In the end, she doesn't care if we go a path or not, she cares that we have a path open in the first place."
 MRY_army_quality_title: "Improve Army Quality"
 MRY_army_quality_desc: "The Hakurei Clan basques in their stories of hunting powerful youkai down and winning battles against all odds. They are also generally known for their experienced fighting shrine maidens.\nMeanwhile, the Moriya Clan gets mostly admirers for Sanae as soldiers, who, to be fair, serve as good cannon fodder, but are ashamed to show off.\nKanako is aware of that and wishes for proper training of these men and fighting experience for our army."
 MRY_suwako_organizing_title: "Expand the Bureaucracy"
 MRY_suwako_organizing_desc: "Suwako has expressed yet again a wish. This time it is about the bureaucracy of the Moriya Shrine - or rather its lack of. She states that wants to take a break from all the paperwork and wants us to have a competent replacement for her - the way of how is free to choose for us."
 MRY_abundance_of_mana_title: "Abundance of Faith"
 MRY_abundance_of_mana_desc: "The best way of measuring a Gensokyan theocracy's efficiency is by spectating its monthly mana and faith income. Both Kanako and Suwako have sworn that if our realm gains an abundance of faith they will bless our donation box personally."
 MRY_miracle_worker_title: "Miracle Worker"
 MRY_miracle_worker_desc: "Our mistress Sanae is famous for her ability to cause miracles. But there are still non-believers who deny her abilities. They shall see the power of Sanae's abilities first hand!"

 LIL_colonize_australia_title: "Colonize Australia"
 LIL_colonize_australia_desc: "Well, Cirno was partially right: on this land nothing is upside down. However, it is still free land to grab! Land for us fairies, who have enough of the chaos happening in Gensokyo!" 
 LIL_continue_the_voyage_title: "Continue the Voyage"
 LIL_continue_the_voyage_desc: "We know now for certain that the Outworld is not a myth but a real thing! However, we still have no idea where its world border is! We should travel westwards and find out what other wonders might be hidden there!"
 LIL_conquer_indonesia_title: "The Spice Islands"
 LIL_conquer_indonesia_desc: "While our fairy explorers discover the wonders of the world, Lily got an idea: on the many islands near Australia there are some weird plants. After tasting one (and getting unconscious from it) she noticed that these plants are extremely hot... and that some people of Gensokyo have complained about a lack of spices in their meals. So her idea is to bring these spices to Gensokyo. But first these islands needs to become part of our realm..."

 LIL_the_enemy_of_my_enemy_desc: "Our beautiful home has the unfortunate luck to be located just between two of the most dangerous fairy bullies in Gensokyo! However, not all is lost. While Marisa seems to be liked by everyone, we know for certain that Remilia Scarlet is currently in a fight with Satori Komeiji. While the mysterious and sinister satori doesn't like contact with people outside Former Hell, she might have an open ear for Lily. After all, the enemy of my enemy is my friend..."
 LIL_gather_allies_title: "Gather Allies"
 LIL_gather_allies_desc: "Although Chireiden is an option, they are not the only one in Gensokyo. We need to find other allies if our realm wants to survive in Gensokyo."

 LIL_chireiden_question_desc: "Long ago we considered in seeking help against the Scarlet Devil at the Komeijis. Now, regardless of having taken this help or not, our realm has reached a state, where it no longer needs the support of Satori. However, the Former Hell is a location of many enslaved fairies! While we are not Cirnia, which would rush the liberation of these fairies, it is still our duty to prepare an invasion against Satori."
 LIL_chireiden_question_with_crd: "We accepted the support of Chireiden and the event '§YKomeiji's Demand§!' has occurred."

 LIL_CRD_invasion_title: "Invade Chireiden"
 LIL_CRD_invasion_desc: "Regardless of our history with Satori, we cannot allow her to continue owning zombie fairies in her realm! Chireiden must be stopped in their acts of defiling nature and the spirit of Spring!"
 LIL_colonize_hope_title: "Colonize the Cape"
 LIL_colonize_hope_desc: "While our scouts have reported of a \"New World\" in the East, we cannot forget the outside world in the West! It houses many natural wonders and has even economical benefits too! We should colonize the Cape of Good Hope and see how much hope it generates for us!"
 LIL_cape_company_title: "Establish Trade Company"
 LIL_cape_company_desc: "The land of this continent is not very rich, but it at least does not have Winter, which gives it a great plus. Apparently however, there is more to it: some strange looking humans have asked to buy this land of us. Of course our wise ruler Lily declined and kept it for fairy kin, but we should consider colonizing more of this weird continent. Maybe we will even get some money out of it!"

 LIL_build_fort_title: "Fortify [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]"

 LIL_improve_capital_title: "Develop [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]"
 LIL_improve_capital_desc: "A capital city is nothing without a good infrastructure. While fortifying made sure our glorious city won't fall into enemy hands, it still lacks the buildings every fairy needs in their life. Let's change that!"
 LIL_attack_the_devil_title: "Attack the Scarlet Devil"
 LIL_attack_the_devil_desc: "Now that we have a powerful alliance, we should end the biggest threat to the region: Remilia Scarlet! We should strike them down before the Scarlet Devil can use her charisma to build an even bigger alliance!"

 LIL_gems_and_choco_desc: "The New World is full with wonders we have never seen in Gensokyo! So many beautiful gems and so much of this new strange plant called \"cocoa\"! While the gems are obviously valuable, the true value of this cocoa is that what you use them to make, which is CHOCOLATE! No matter what we do, we HAVE to collect them! Chocolate is the ultimate fairy food and our kind ruler Lily knows it!"

 LIL_gather_troops_desc: "We are not in the best position: over eager fairies who try to use force to unite our kin, weird \"poltergeister\", a secret goddess, a mean bully witch and a sinister vampire! If Lily and our people want to survive in this rough state we have to actually build an army!"
 LIL_conquer_fairies_title: "End the Fairy Wars"
 LIL_conquer_fairies_desc: "Larva, Cirno and Three Fairies are locked in eternal infighting and chaos. These brutal fairy wars just are not good for our people!

 LIL_naval_dominance_title: "The Spring Armada"
 LIL_naval_dominance_desc: "Putting a focus on the navy is good and all, but we should go a step further. Lily has envisioned a huge realm where our kind can live in freedom and security and as such we need a huger fleet. Let's build the Spring Armada, which will put any other fleet into shame!"

 TFR_the_fairy_wars_desc: "The three glorious fairies, our rulers Sunny Milk, Luna Child and Star Sapphire, once tried to unite the fairies, but Cirno has seen it as a declaration of war and fought against our just rulers.

 TFR_conquer_lil_lrv_title: "Conquer the Weak"
 TFR_conquer_lil_lrv_desc: "Lily White and Eternity Larva are a disgrace to fairy kind! They are weak and don't play any pranks against the non-fairies!

 TFR_gather_power_title: "Grow in Power"
 TFR_gather_power_desc: "The unification of our kind is almost done. The only fairy remaining is Cirno.

However, building bombs isn't the usual skill a fairy has, so we will need the assistance of those humans or kappa... or rather their plans.\nWith Sunny's special abilities, the fairy spies can steal the plans from Kappapolis or from Rika's Place and we can build our own bomb!"

Also, looks like this Forest of Magic is a land suitable for fairies to live in. Some actually even live in parts of the forest, although under magician overlords.

 LRV_master_weather_control_desc: "A strange Hell Fairy once came to Eternity Larva and gave her a torch. It was Clownpiece and the torch was supposed to cause madness, but in the hands of Eternity Larva, the torch caused a sudden change of the weather and made it better! Clownpiece may have left us and the torch is gone with her, but the weather power still is part of Eternity. All she has to do now is to master it!"

 LRV_try_new_powers_out_desc: "As a fairy, who got the power of the Torch of Clownpiece, Eternity Larva was already astonishing. But now as a goddess there's no telling what possible strength she could have! All what is required for her is testing her ability out and see what will happen."
 LRV_try_new_powers_out_ct: "Are ally or subject of [Root.GetName], are in war and have been target of the diplomatic action §YFluttering Summer§!."

 LRV_orange_flower_field_desc: "According to ancient Japanese legends, an envoy of the Tenno went to the Land of Eternal Night to bring Tokoyo no Kami an Orange Flower as sign of good will. Now if Okina, Hina and the Akis are right that our mistress is indeed a goddess, than this event must have happened here in Gensokyo, the only dream world. Keine mentioned that the mayor of the Human Capital possesses the only Orange Flower, which comes from Japan. We should take it and see what happens."
 LRV_face_kasen_title: "The Hermit Sage"
 LRV_face_kasen_desc: "Kasen Ibaraki is one of the sages of Gensokyo and an important personality. Even thought her realm is quite small compared to the other sages the real challenge is to impress her and make her acknowledge Eternity as a new Goddess of Gensokyo. Now, impressing her would usually require a danmaku fight or a feat of strength, but she wants it to make it easy on our good [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and just demands a renovation for her home."

 LRV_kaguya_of_eternal_night_desc: "When it comes to the theme of \"eternity\" there is really only one person, which is the princess from the moon: Kaguya Houraisan! If Eternity Larva's connection to any godhood is any true then the chance might be high that she lost her powers to Kaguya as both she and Tokoyo no Kami represent the Eternal Night! We should march into Eientei and ask her personally!"
 LRV_netherworld_of_eternal_night_title: "Restoring the Memories"
 LRV_netherworld_of_eternal_night_desc: "It is crystal clear now that these goddesses of Gensokyo are telling the truth and that Eternity Larva can be indeed the God of Eternal Night. However, as long our good mistress cannot remember this her claim of returning to godhood is iffy at best. Fortunately there is a way to restore the memory of a fairy which is by infusing her with the power of spirit itself. With the Snow spring Incident the evil demon tree has consumed much of the spring energy, but when Yuyuko got defeated the tree unleashed a good portion of this energy. Some of that energy though is still left and can be used for returning the memory Eternity once had."

Eiki doesn't care for the power a person has but the way how this power gets wielded. She acknowledges Eternity as a worth goddess when our people acknowledge her as a goddess too!"

 LRV_face_yukari_desc: "No youkai is more infamous than Yukari Yakumo, one of the big sages of Gensokyo. If Eternity hopes to be recognized as a goddess, she needs Yukari's approval. Unfortunately, Yukari is a very sleepy youkai and the only real way to wake her up is my knocking on her door... preferably with cannons."

 LRV_face_lunarians_desc: "As a fairy, Eternity Larva could not remember who or what was the reason that she lost her powers in the first place, but now as a goddess it is coming to her again. The Lunarians experimented with the powers of the night and the moon and caused a magical feedback loop in the hope to find Eirin and Kaguya easier in Gensokyo. In the process they made Tokoyo no Kami's abilities inaccessible and turned Eternity Larva into the fairy we once knew.\nIt is clear that these Lunarians are a threat and as such we need to eliminate them once and for all!"

 LRV_colonizing_power_desc: "Exploring is fine and dandy, but we should go a step further and build our own colonies - and we will do it in moderation. Unlike certain spring fanatic fairies or want-to-be pirates, our focus will still remain on Gensokyo. Just a few colonies will help us out."

 SFF_past_and_present_desc: "The Background of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] of [Root.GetName] is quite unique - even for Gensokyan circumstances. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] witnessed the birth of the Spell Card Rule System and the reforms of Hakurei Shintoism and – unlike certain other prominent members of the North – moved with the flow of time. Due to this background, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] followers are divided into the old generation that follows the existing Old Hakurei Shinto and the new generation that follows the Shinto that was reformed by Reimu. But as their conflict grows, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] feels the need to unite them."

 SFF_fence_of_the_garden_title: "Fence of the Garden"
 SFF_fence_of_the_garden_desc: "Internal conflicts have been consolidated, but we must also prepare for growing external threats. The land of the [Root.GovernmentName] is a very beautiful garden, but it needs a fence to protect the garden to stop the invaders."
 SFF_prepare_war_title: "Prepare War"
 SFF_prepare_war_desc: "The conflicts in Gensokyo are turning into entire wars with large armies instead of the previous danmaku battles. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] herself has formidable powers, but she can't go to war alone. For the defense of the [Root.GovernmentName] and for preemptive strikes against the enemy, we need brave soldiers and generals to follow her."
 SFF_conquer_dream_sisters_title: "The Dream Sisters"
 SFF_conquer_dream_sisters_desc: "To the north of our [Root.GovernmentName] is the Dream World where the devil sisters with angel wings live. Originally this area was the land of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and these sisters were friends to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], but while [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was away, this sister occupied the Dream World and declared it their own land. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] now wants to reclaim this area and get these mischievous sisters back into our realm."
 SFF_conquer_dream_sisters_tt: "The rewards of the mission will vary depending on whether the Dream World is fully annexed or subjugated."
 SFF_suppress_neighborhood_title: "Suppress Neighborhood"
 SFF_suppress_neighborhood_desc: "There are many powerful forces in Gensokyo, but there are also relatively small ones. In the south of our [Root.GovernmentName] there are two realms: one is led by a young Tsukumogami while the other is a union of fragile youkai. They are too weak to protect themselves! We need to put them in our sphere of influence, protect them from the threat of other forces and strengthen our power while we are at it."

 SFF_rivalry_of_the_past_desc: "The evil spirit, Mima was once a powerful witch with equal powers to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], but she had long disappeared. However, she decided to reappear recently and declared an own \"empire\". She revealed her ambition to conquer Gensokyo by leading a powerful undead army. It is clear that this vengeful spirit has lost her mind. We should put her back to rest."
 SFF_the_flower_tank_title: "Flower tank?"
 SFF_the_flower_tank_desc: "Besides Mima, others from the past have decided to make their long-lost existence noticeable again – one of them is Rika. She's just an ordinary human being, but her skills in engineering and building machines, especially the 'self-moving wheeled danmaku battery', are more than that of the kappa. What attracts [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s attention, among others, is the danmaku battery she named the Flower Tank. Considering the name, is there something to do with the magic of flowers?"
 SFF_path_toward_makai_title: "Path towards Makai"
 SFF_path_toward_makai_desc: "Like other great persons of the past, another one emerged from the dust of history: the Goddess Shinki. There has been reports that the demons of Makai have begun to cause chaos again. To ensure they are no threat to nature, our good [Root.Monarch.GetName] has ordered the invasion of Makai to punish them again. But in order to send troops to Makai, we must first pass the old Hakurei Shrine. Unexpectedly, a samurai was training at the shrine and she asserts no one would be able to pass as long Reimu remains undefeated. Although a honorable fighter, she is in the eyes of [Root.Monarch.GetName] nothing more than a weakling compared to Reimu. We need to drive out this presumptuous Samurai and secure the passage to Makai."
 SFF_showdown_with_goddess_title: "Showdown with Shinki"
 SFF_showdown_with_goddess_desc: "Finally [Root.Monarch.GetName] reopened the Gate of Makai. Like so many years ago, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has returned to Makai – and the Makaian remember it too well. Compared to Reimu, Marisa and Mima, who once stepped their foot on Makain land, [Root.GetName] is causing fear! And  again, the Goddess Shinki is holding out to stop her – despite her previous defeat. Sometimes history repeats itself..."
 SFF_conflict_with_humans_title: "Conflict with Humans"
 SFF_conflict_with_humans_desc: "Humans don't know the grace of nature. They indiscriminately claim land, pollute water, cut down forests and hunt down animals. As our [Root.GovernmentName]'s borders their capital now, conflicts with them are growing even bigger. In particular, they are sweeping wealth from all over Gensokyo and use it to develop their city on nature's cost. We will make them pay for destroying nature and make their wealth ours."
 SFF_ultimate_magic_title: "Ultimate Magic"
 SFF_ultimate_magic_desc: "Of the south of Human Capital is the legendary Forest of Magic. It once used to be a place for fairies, but after the events in Makai years ago, Marisa and Alice moved into this forest and made it to their home. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] remembers Marisa breaking into her mansion and making a mess and Alice standing up to her with what she calls 'Ultimate Magic'. After defeating Alice, [Root.Monarch.GetName] tried to find out about the Ultimate Magic, but it didn't pay off. It's been a while since then, and according to reports Marisa and Alice have copied  [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s spell and act as if it's their own magic. It seems like they need to be reminded who is the master and who is the novice witch."
 SFF_a_mansion_of_the_lake_title: "The most powerful Youkai"
 SFF_a_mansion_of_the_lake_desc: "Rumors of a very strong youkai have reached the ears of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Like our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of the past, this youkai is said to be a sleepyhead, wearing a parasol like [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] too and pretends to be the most powerful and wisest of youkai kind. Worse of all, she even acts like she is on top of the other youkai. It is said that there is something suspicious about her behavior that is different from other youkai. There seems to be some reason for her to act so arrogant and suspicious. We should meet with that strange youkai and see how much truth is to her superiority – with a good danmaku duel but of course..."
 SFF_judge_the_judge_title: "Flower of Higan"
 SFF_judge_the_judge_desc: "In Higan, the far opposite side of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s Garden in Gensokyo, there grows special flowers called 'Higanbana'. [Root.Monarch.GetName] wants to research the power of death which is kept within these flowers. But their owner, Shiki Eiki-Yamaxanadu, has preached to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and as a result they have clashed in the past, so relationship between these two is at its low. Of course, [Root.Monarch.GetName] could face Eiki in a danmaku duel, but in raw power both are at the same level. Instead, we will need to go the diplomatic path to get one of these flowers."

 SFF_the_land_where_sunrise_desc: "The humans of Gensokyo have the intriguing hobby of arranging their flowers and plants in special ways so that a room has more \"life\" due to these flower arrangement. However, it is clear that the humans here are outdated in their ways of flower handling - they don't care for aesthetically pleasing patterns.\nFortunately, this art is still alive and developing in the Gensokyo's ancient home: Japan. According to rumors, the shogun Yoshimasa Ashikaga is a patrons of arts and recognizes the deeper meaning of flowers in the high form he calls \"Ikebana\" – Making flowers alive. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is highly interested in meeting this man of culture and learn his wisdom from him."

 SFF_bamboo_forest_of_the_lost_desc: "To the south of the sunflower fields there is the Bamboo Forest of Lost – a forest which SHOULD be silent like any good forest should be. But it's not the case because Kaguya, the mistress of the Bamboo Forest, and her rival Mokou fight every day. The problem is that when they fight, there are fires everywhere, so they are not only loud but also a fire hazard to the precious garden. If they can't stop fighting, we have to come forward and force them.\n\nHowever, there is one good thing about the Bamboo Forest: the Lunarian sage created a garden filled with ingredients for her medicines. The flowers there would make a fine addition to [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s flower collection!"
 SFF_empire_of_the_sunflower_title: "Empire of the Sunflower"
 SFF_empire_of_the_sunflower_desc: "Sunflowers are flowers that bloom straight to the sun, and they symbolize their strong standing under the power of nature. The same goes for our [Root.GovernmentName]. We have an obligation to embrace the forces of nature and the sun to build a powerful strength in Gensokyo and to spread this power around the world. We will expand our influence to gain the power of plants and nature around the world and to become a more complete empire."
 SFF_continent_of_the_nature_title: "Power of the Sun"
 SFF_continent_of_the_nature_desc: "The native people of this High Mountains have developed religious rituals to worship the sun. Our shrine maidens and witches have discovered that combining these rituals with our knowledge can actually amplify the power we receive from the sun for our flowers. However, in order to get that power to a meaningful level, the range of consciousness should be increased more broadly. So it seems that we need to expand our influence in this mountainous area."
 SFF_empire_of_the_sun_title: "Empire of the Mother Nature"
 SFF_empire_of_the_sun_desc: "We preserved and studied the various plants in the Gensokyo and outside world, and we built the gardens of the world that no one had ever seen. Also, the power of Mother Nature from this plants and gardens has made us the most powerful nation in the world, both militarily and economically. This is the power of Mother Nature, and we are the true empires of Mother Nature who deserve to deal with this power!"
 SFF_land_beyond_the_ocean_title: "Land Beyond the Ocean"
 SFF_land_beyond_the_ocean_desc: "We got a special document during the war in Bamboo Forest. The document is a diary of Houraisan Kaguya, an exiled Lunarian and the ruler of Bamboo Forest, written wandering around the world with the wise of the moon who was assisting her before she came to Gensokyo. Particularly interesting to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is the story of the continent, which lies beyond the vast ocean east of Gensokyo. This continent is much wider than Gensokyo, and it retains the image of nature. In accordance with the will of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], we have decided to establish an intermediate stop on a large island in the ocean, and to send adventurous explorers and colonists to the continent for investigation."

 SFF_quantity_and_quality_desc: "The quantity and quality of armies sometimes seem to be inversely proportional to each other. If it's large, it's bad. If it's good, it's small.

 SFF_necessity_of_the_navy_desc: "In the days of Hakurei Barrier, the sea was not an important subject in Gensokyo. However, as the Barrier has fallen, many realms recognized the importance of the sea and began to move beyond it. We are confident to be Gensokyo's strongest ground force, but we should not neglect the importance of the navy."
 SFF_a_vast_ocean_title: "A Vast Ocean"
 SFF_a_vast_ocean_desc: "The ocean beyond the barrier seems much wider and infinite than we thought. Other countries in Gensokyo are already expanding their presence beyond the sea.

 SFF_training_ocean_navy_desc: "Since explorations to the beyond of the great border have started, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s interest has been directed at the flowers and plants of the outside world. But to secure them safely, we'll need an ocean navy that can operate in the distant seas."

 SFF_native_of_the_high_mountain_desc: "Our explorers found the towering mountains of the New Continent coast and natives living there.

 SFF_invader_from_the_west_desc: "We have successfully established ourselves in the New Continent, but there appeared those who are jealous of our success. Claiming themselves to be from a distant continent, they are showing a greedy interest in things that would be money for them, especially gold, rather than in the beautiful nature of the New Continent.

According to the colonists and natives, this rain forest is stretched out so wide that even the natives cannot enter the deepest part of the forest.

In particular, indigenous people living on the coast of this rain forest believe that the gods they serve live in the forest and hold the forest sacred. As it was in the New World, it seems necessary to send our shrine maidens to study the strength and faith of life in this rain forest. However, we will have to send a small group of maidens as the distance is way too large for maintaining more shrine maidens oversea. Fortunately, more are not needed as a small colony will already be able to achieve sufficient results by seeking the consent of the natives."

Most people in Europe believe monotheistic religion, but in the past, there was a religion in northern Europe that believed in many gods, especially those related to forests, similar to Gensokyo. There are few traces of this religion now, but there are still thick forests in the area they considered a holy place, and if we send shrine maidens, will be able to study the power left in this forest.

 SCR_meiling_vs_sakuya_desc: "Although Meiling is a very reliable and loyal gate keeper, she gets often accused for slacking off. [Root.Monarch.GetName] of course doesn't believe these accusations and Meiling proofs it daily with her training. We should consider giving our troops a similar training too."
 SCR_expand_the_army_title: "The Grand Army"
 SCR_expand_the_army_desc: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has great ambitions - way too great with the army size we have right now to fulfil them. In a world, where danmaku duels are no longer enough to get your will through, we need to expand our army and prepare our people for the battles beforehand."
 SCR_meilings_ambitions_title: "Face the Dragon"
 SCR_meilings_ambitions_desc: "Meiling always likes to talk about her homeland, the mighty realm of the China, the Empire of the Middle. She says no realm in Gensokyo could beat 3500 years of history. While our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] respects such love for the homeland, it still sounds like a challenge we should take. If we can even beat the mighty dragon than there's nobody who could endanger our new Empire!"
 SCR_the_investigator_issue_title: "Deal with Reimu"
 SCR_the_investigator_issue_desc: "Gensokyo is a wild land and many of their residents try to do their own shenanigans, which later often get labelled as \"Incidents\". Of course Remilia's prank of releasing the Scarlet Mist has been treated as one of these Incident. However, not everyone is happy if a youkai is doing mischief and so Reimu, the shrine maiden of Gensokyo, usually faces these youkai. She can be quite the nuisance, but she can be also quite lax with her job. We should convince her to let us pass with our activities by either using our charisma or bribing her."
 SCR_power_of_favors_title: "Trustful Alliance"
 SCR_power_of_favors_desc: "While overwhelming power is nice and all, we need allies who can admire our strength. But not any ordinary allies - they need to be enchanted by the glorious charisma of our mistress herself and have a deep trust in us!"
 SCR_eternal_charisma_title: "Eternal Charisma"
 SCR_eternal_charisma_desc: "War is one way to enforce our mistress' will, but it is not the most elegant one. Soldiers die, land gets devastated and Ducats vanish. Thanks to the charisma of our mistress however, we can ensure that at least the soldiers and the land of another, less important country get effected.\nThe world shall now the Eternal Scarlet Charisma and oblige to our bidding!"
 SCR_eternal_charisma_ct: "Is NOT an ally nor a subject of [Root.GetName], but has at least §Y65§! Trust of us."

 SCR_patchoulis_alchemy_title: "Patchouli's Alchemy"
 SCR_patchoulis_alchemy_desc: "The Scarlet Devil Mansion has a wide staff of maidens and residents, but none is as educated and full with knowledge than Patchouli Knowledge, the librarian of the mansion. While our mistress manages the politics and diplomacy of the Scarlet Devil Mansion, Patchouli's task is to make sure that we will not fall behind in technology.\nShe recently made breakthroughs in alchemy, which might help make Koakuma a more useful member of the mansion. We should funnel our administrative efforts in her researches."
 SCR_retake_the_books_title: "Steal from Thieves"
 SCR_retake_the_books_desc: "Marisa Kirisame is one of the two investigators and an infamous witch of Gensokyo. Usually nothing what our mistress concerns. However, Marisa is also a notorious thief and has stolen a lot of Patchouli's tomes in the past, hoarding them somewhere in the Forest of Magic - and occupation of her house alone will not suffice. We need to conquer the forest to have a chance in finding Patchouli's books."
 SCR_koakuma_experiments_title: "Prepare the Library"
 SCR_koakuma_experiments_desc: "Now that the books are back in Patchouli's hands, she has all the knowledge prepared to conduct the experiment. Yet one issue still remains: Voile Library is, as the name might suggest, a library, not an alchemy laboratory. If we want a successful experiment we have to expand the library by building a workshop room."
 SCR_magical_researches_title: "Expand the Library"
 SCR_magical_researches_desc: "After this successful experiment, Patchouli requested for an expansion of the library. We have little reason to not fulfil her wish."
 SCR_investments_in_the_economy_title: "Dominate the Trade"
 SCR_investments_in_the_economy_desc: "Regardless of the continent or the time - money is and always has been power. Power close for the taking! The trade nodes of Gensokyo are filthily rich and can even make the mentally challenged fairies quite wealthy. We should focus on funneling the money of the nodes into our own pockets!"
 SCR_technology_of_the_kappas_title: "Kappa Technology"
 SCR_technology_of_the_kappas_desc: "It is time to expand the influence of our realm! Gensokyo may be a rich continent, yet there is still more to conquer - like the moon for example! While travelling to the moon is trivial for our mistress, our troops sadly don't have this luxury. In order to colonize the moon, we have to take any advantage Gensokyo can give us. One of these is the technology of the kappa, which is crucial for creating a safe and majestic rocket for the vampire mistress' army!"
 SCR_colonize_the_moon_title: "Lunar Conquest"
 SCR_colonize_the_moon_desc: "For a lot of creatures of Gensokyo, the moon has a special effect on them, which influences their power. The moon plays an exceptionally important role for werewolves and ... vampires. By taking over the moon and eliminating the overly aggressive Lunarians, we can accelerate the power of our own realm and soldiers!"

 SCR_the_outworld_title: "Break the Barrier"
 SCR_the_outworld_desc: "The Hakurei Barrier protects Gensokyo from the Outside. Or rather it should. The Barrier has begun to crack and now allows our navy to pass through it. We should exploit this circumstance, break the barrier once and for all and explore the west - the direction where we actually came from."

 SCR_arrive_at_western_africa_title: "The Gold Coast"
 SCR_arrive_at_western_africa_desc: "Our destination is so close, yet so far. Before we can reach our home continent, we have to settle for another colony on Africa.

 SCR_return_to_europe_title: "Land on Europe"
 SCR_return_to_europe_desc: "Now that we have discovered our home continent of old times, we need to establish a base of operation for our grand return. Fortunately, the charisma and the fortune of our mistress allows to make a deal with one of those clueless rulers of Europe. Patchouli recommends to buy one of five islands to make it into our headquarter."
 SCR_flandre_conquers_flanders_title: "Flanders for Flandre"
 SCR_flandre_conquers_flanders_desc: "There is an area called \"Flanders\" in the Lowlands of Europe. It is no coincidence that Flandre has a very similar name as our grand mansion was once placed in this region. While a return of the Scarlet Devil Mansion to its previous location is tempting, the current position of it in Gensokyo is too important as it could be moved. However, Flandre has shown great interest in revisiting our old home, so we should prepare the area for her arrival."
 SCR_fate_and_destruction_are_one_title: "Reign the Lowlands"
 SCR_fate_and_destruction_are_one_desc: "The Scarlet family once was one of the important and influential noble family of Europe with their center of power in the Lowlands. But through a very long chain of events during the medieval era, the Scarlets became vampires and while Remilia and Flandre can control their needs very good, their ancestors could not. As a result of that, the power our realm once had over Europe withered away until the Scarlet Devil Mansion got relocated to Gensokyo.\nIt is time to restore our old position and reign over this land with the power of both sisters!"
 SCR_absolute_scarlet_rule_title: "Absolute Rule"

 SCR_sakuyas_origin_from_great_britain_title: "Sakuya's Origin"
 SCR_sakuyas_origin_from_great_britain_desc: "Not much is known of Sakuya's origin except for two things: she was once a vampire hunter and she has family ties, which root back to the adoptive son of a wealth English nobles family. To be fair, the sources for these information are sketchy at best and Sakuya herself cannot remember anything about it... but it is the only trail we have to uncover the mysteries of our maiden.\nAnd also, England is not really far away from our goals anyway."
 SCR_reconquest_of_french_home_land_title: "French Heritage"
 SCR_reconquest_of_french_home_land_desc: "The Scarlet family had great properties in many countries, but the most valuable ones were the wine fields in France. Due to our vanishing, the French decided to seize our land and use it for themselves! We should remind them whose property the wine fields truly are!"
 SCR_dissolve_germania_title: "Dismantle Germania"
 SCR_dissolve_germania_desc: "The \"Holy Roman Empire\" is neither Holy, nor Roman nor an Empire. It's existence is a disgrace to the might it once was and should cede to exist."

 SCR_defeat_the_vampire_hunters_desc: "A long time ago, many fairies, western 'youkai' and especially vampires got hunted down by the Christians of Europe and only a handful managed to escape to Gensokyo. We cannot let the crimes of the Christians sit here unpunished! We have to hunt the ones, who hunt our mistress' kind!"
 SCR_the_scarlet_crusade_title: "The Scarlet Crusade"
 SCR_the_scarlet_crusade_desc: "We left Europe ages ago, but we still remember the time when Anatolia and Balkans had respective masters. Now, that we've returned, all we see is a civilization, which murdered the only Empire, which even predates the Scarlet dynasty. While we have no legitimate right, it is better for the sake of Europe if the lands of Anatolia and Balkans are in our hands."
 SCR_eliminate_the_wrong_vampire_title: "Impale Dracula"
 SCR_eliminate_the_wrong_vampire_desc: "The Scarlets are not the only vampire lords of the world. Deep hidden in the Romanian lands of the Wallachia hides the sinister Dracula. Although Remilia once claimed to be a descendant of him, she quickly revised that statement when she heard about the doings of Dracula. We should find him and impale his heart before he can continue giving us vampires a bad reputation!"

 SCR_ultimate_remilia_title: "Remilia's Legacy"

 CRD_SDM_nuisance_title: "Tame the Scarlet Devil"
 CRD_SDM_nuisance_desc: "Showing the administrative superiority has convinced the other residents of the Scarlet Devil Mansion, Remilia remains stubborn.

 CRD_house_united_title: "United Mansions"
 CRD_house_united_desc: "After so many trials, the [SCR.GetName] is finally ready to obey. All what is left is making this relation official."
 CRD_taste_for_power_title: "Taste of Power"
 CRD_taste_for_power_desc: "In the early days of Former Hell, the place was filled with demons and leftover spirits the yama did not want to deal with. Fortunately for them, the Komeiji family moved into this region and took over Former Hell through diplomacy and manipulation.\nHowever, this was just foretaste. Kingdoms conquer land through their own force, true empires use subjects to do the dirty work for them instead. We should expand our influence and upgrade our vassals to even more formidable brutes for our bidding."
 CRD_taste_for_power_tt: "Is §YSatori's Vassal§! with §Y100§! Development or more and less than §Y10.0%§! Liberty Desire."
 CRD_third_eye_title: "Third Eye"
 CRD_third_eye_desc: "Every satori has a third eye, which allows them to read the mind of the people around them. Although the minds of these people are often ... disturbing, they are a useful tool for our diplomatic ambitions. Our government and politic revolves around this very ability."
 CRD_mind_reading_diplomacy_title: "Mind-Reading Diplomacy"
 CRD_mind_reading_diplomacy_desc: "The expansion through direct conquest will raise a lot of alert in neighboring countries. It may be more efficient to claiming that we are the guardians of small countries as entice and charm them into our sphere of influence. And [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s ability will be a great help to this strategy."
 CRD_perfect_mind_manipulation_title: "Perfect Mind Manipulation"
 CRD_perfect_mind_manipulation_desc: "Reading the mind is one basic ability every satori possesses. But the potential is much, much larger. Our mistress Satori has seen it and knows that the third eye can reach abilities some would consider... unnatural - the power of mind control.\nHowever, to achieve this state our kind needs to practice and learn all the tricks and techniques and perfect their skills.\nIt is our utter highest priority to do that."

 CRD_training_army_title: "Army of the Underworld"
 CRD_training_army_desc: "Life in Former Hell is mostly as peaceful as it can get in Hell. Sadly this is not a constant though.

 CRD_two_heavens_under_one_sky_title: "Two Heavens under One Sky"
 CRD_two_heavens_under_one_sky_desc: "Our realm has grown to a respectable power in Gensokyo and we even have the might of Hell and Heaven on our side. Yet we can't say we're the true masters of Hell and Heaven as long the Celestial Empire has its Mandate of Heaven. If Gensokyo were in isolation as before, their claim about mandate of heaven would have nothing to do with us. but the world has changed and there cannot be two empires that govern in the name of heaven. We must drive out this pretender and let them know that we are the only master of the heaven."
 CRD_scarlet_demand_title: "Convince Remilia"
 CRD_scarlet_demand_desc: "While the conquest of the Scarlet Devil Mansion was a breeze, the childish vampire Remilia refuses to acknowledge Satori as her only ruler. Of course Satori could hypnotize Remilia and force obedience, but this would be only a temporary solution - and the reputation of our kind is already suffering more than enough.\nNo. The only way to get Remilia's respect is by showing her the vastly superiority which the satori are at house holding a realm."
 CRD_quest_of_religion_title: "Show Religious Color"
 CRD_quest_of_religion_desc: "[Root.GetName] has never been a very religious realm. The spirits and demons of Former Hell usually enjoy their Hakurei beliefs in peace. However, this changed when a radical shrine maiden has introduced a new way of Shintoism in Gensokyo. Many of our people have been converted over time and due to the nature of this ... Moriya Shintoism... they want to spread their faith. Whether driving this faith out or accepting it, we need a quick decision from [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 CRD_resolving_religious_confusion_title: "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s Decision"

 CRD_gensokyan_politics_title: "Gensokyan Politics"
 CRD_gensokyan_politics_desc: "Our realm has a history of isolationism, and for the most part it works quite fine. There were not many reasons to interact with others and the lowborn people of Gensokyo looked at us in fear and spite anyway due to our mind reading ability.\nHowever, the stench of war is clouding the air. In times like these, even a \"frowned upon\" realm like [Root.GetName] makes a valuable ally. We should exploit these circumstances and build our own net of alliances."
 CRD_fortify_chireiden_title: "Fortify [Root.GetName]"
 CRD_fortify_chireiden_desc: "Our home region might be underground, but it is horrendous to defend. Everything is just flat land and no natural defense blocks possible invaders. We should construct forts at key positions to avoid our downfall."

 CRD_expand_infrastructure_title: "Hellish Infrastructure"
 CRD_expand_infrastructure_desc: "Our home region has been abandoned by the government of the yama and the oversight of Hecatia.

We should give them exactly that."
 CRD_stabilize_former_hell_title: "Dismantle the Estates"
 CRD_stabilize_former_hell_desc: "Now that the oni are fully on our side, it is time to get rid of the power of the scheming estates. The rule of [Root.Monarch.GetName] is absolute and we must ensure that it stays that way!"
 CRD_seize_the_newspaper_title: "Seize the Newspaper"
 CRD_seize_the_newspaper_desc: "The reputation of our kind has never been in a good spot, but these pesky tengu in their mountains are making thins much worse. Every day, they write new papers explaining their justification of owning the Youkai Mountain and printing a bad image of Former Hell - and much worse - of satori kind!\nWe should move these birdbrains from the printers as far away as possible."
 CRD_conquer_the_hell_region_title: "Unite the Hells"
 CRD_conquer_the_hell_region_desc: "The yama had their time - and they did not clean the mess what is their new hell. It is up to us to end these beast gang wars and unite Hell and Former Hell to one, centralized region."

We should get to the Masks Gallery and obtain this mask for the young mistress Koishi."
 CRD_paradise_of_spirit_title: "Exploit Hell's Resource"
 CRD_paradise_of_spirit_desc: "While the improvement of infrastructure was more than welcome, many of our people started demanding goods and luxuries we cannot afford to import. Fortunately, Former Hell is a region with rich resources. We should expand the infrastructure even further and construct several manufactories in order to develop our realm into an economic powerhouse."
 CRD_moriya_matter_title: "Moriya's Matter"
 CRD_moriya_matter_desc: "Moriya Shrine is the cause of all the religious problems in [Root.GetName]. They gave immense power to our Hell raven, but in return they spread their religion underground and caused great dismay in Former Hell. Additionally, they all did this in order to accelerate their own plans instead of improving our life at all. We need to take complete control of them so that they cannot longer do this nonsense."
 CRD_lazy_hakurei_miko_title: "Scold the lazy Reimu"
 CRD_lazy_hakurei_miko_desc: "The religious split has been solved in our realm. However, it was due to our efforts, NOT the ones of Reimu Hakurei - the person who should be responsible solving issues like that. Instead, they just gave us empty words.\nReimu has already proven to be a lazy shrine maiden. She must pay with her beloved shrine to compensate this laziness."
 CRD_find_koishi_mission_title: "Find Koishi"
 CRD_find_koishi_mission_desc: "Koishi Komeiji is the little sister of Satori and a very free spirit. Like her sister, Koishi is a satori and possesses mind manipulative abilities. However, she disabled them by closing her third eye forever. As a side effect though, she lost the ability to make conscious decisions and acts completely on behalf of her instincts.\nShe vanished then from [Root.GetName] one day until, through pure coincidence, we have found her in the Outworld!"

 CRD_the_scarletts_title: "The Scarlets"

 CRD_two_mansions_one_dynasty_title: "Control the Mansions"
 CRD_two_mansions_one_dynasty_desc: "The Misty Lake in the east houses knowledge and weapons of mass destruction. It would be better if the Scarlet Devil Mansion would be under our control as Remilia is not particularly trustworthy - and as a bonus: Koishi will be happy to play with her friend Flandre."
 CRD_appease_the_hell_residents_title: "Appease the Estates"
 CRD_appease_the_hell_residents_desc: "The reputation of satoris is horrendous in the over world. But it is nowhere better here down in the underworld. The estates are plotting against the rule of [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] and want to rule over hell instead. Currently, we are in no position to take away their power, so instead we should improve our relations with them."
 CRD_improve_oni_relations_title: "Improve Oni Relations"
 CRD_improve_oni_relations_desc: "Not all inhabitants of Former Hell were intended to be here. Of course there is our kind - the satoris - who have found their way in here. But there are also the savage oni, once lords of the Youkai Mountains. It all changed when the Tengu attacked.\nDespite having lost everything they had, the oni are more than content with their exclave in Former Hell, and as their form of \"rent\" they pay us yearly a tribute.\nThey could be a much more useful asset to us though, but it will not only take a few nice words but also enough alcohol for the whole oni civilization. Luckily, Reimu has a whole storage town. We just need to take it from her."
 CRD_show_strength_title: "Show Strength"
 CRD_show_strength_desc: "The relations with the oni is improving, but they are not fully convinced to serve us. They want us to show strength and militaristic power before they consider giving us their fullest support."

 CRD_form_the_komeiji_navy_desc: "A mighty army is great for protecting our interests in Gensokyo. However, Utsuho and Rin insist to see more of the world and to guard our properties in the Outworld. [Root.Monarch.GetName] likes this idea, but for that we need a proper navy - a Komeiji Navy."
 CRD_break_the_barrier_title: "Break the Barrier"
 CRD_break_the_barrier_desc: "The Hakurei Barrier protects Gensokyo from the Outside. Or rather it should. The Barrier had begun to crack and allows our new navy to pass through it. We should exploit this circumstance, break the barrier once and for all and send Utsuho and Rin to great Outworld."

 CRD_curiosity_of_the_pets_desc: "The hell cat Rin Kaenbyou and hell crow Utsuho Reiuji are Satori's most trusted pets, but they can be such nuisances sometimes.

 CRD_flame_god_of_the_india_desc: "Our Hell crow, Reiji Utsuho, is bird brain, but she has talent. She was able to wield the powerful fire of Yatagarasu, given by Kanako. It's only natural that Utsuho felt attracted to a region, which houses a mighty deity with similar powers - Agni, the Hindu god of fire, who is still seeing worship to this day. Of course Utsuho wants to get into contact with this god and wants to harness it for her own. However, if we let her go to India without backup and securities, chances are high that she blows up the land instead of finding Agni.\nWe should instead establish a base in India and conquer pieces of this subcontinent so Utsuho has a secured path to the deity **without** getting the idea to nuke the people, the land and probably more."

 CRD_pets_new_home_desc: "With our base in India, we now have a serious foothold in India and can look for this flame god. According to Hindu myths, there is a whole forest dedicated in his honor.

The residents, who remained went on war to seize control, but the Komeiji dynasty arrived and seized Former Hell through warfare and diplomacy.\nBut Former Hell still is only a shell of Hell actually has to offer.

 HKR_discover_europe_desc: "A lot of time has passed since the Breaking of the Hakurei Barrier and a lot of foreigners have come to Gensokyo. Fortunately they are usually peaceful traders and no threat to our homeland at all.

 HKR_eternal_night_incident_desc: "An usual night. Or at least an usual night in the eyes of a human. But for the youkai it is incredible nerve-wrenching night as the Moon, which usually shines over the Gensokyo is replaced with nothing but an imitation. This was the rumored Eternal Night Incident, caused by Lunarian princess, who tried to hide from her people from the moon. To the youkai's appeal the fake Moon didn't persist for long as the princess got defeated."

 HKR_control_over_the_tree_desc: "In the Netherworld lives a demonic cherry blossom tree, which attracts many people to their death. While it is sealed by the ghost princess Yuyuko herself it is still a great danger for everyone - and the fact that Yuyuko also has to rule over a realm doesn't help the seal. We should take control over this dangerous tree and reinforce the seals with Hakurei spells."
 HKR_convert_the_human_capital_title: "Convert the Human Capital"
 HKR_convert_the_human_capital_desc: "The humans in the Human Capital, the heart of Gensokyo, are kindhearted, but they follow a heretic religion from old times. These Buddhistic minds stray them from the Gensokyan gods and corrupt even more people. We should stop this heresy immediately."

 HKR_stop_the_taoistic_heresy_desc: "In Gensokyo there's not only the Buddhistic heresy. In recent times a stranger from the ancient land Japan arrived in Gensokyo and converted the local population - only through her charismatic speeches - to the strange religion of Taoism.

 HKR_subjugate_sanae_desc: "Sanae, the shrine maiden of the Moriya Shrine, is a lovely person and a worthy rival.

 HKR_create_an_empire_title: "Hakurei Empire"
 HKR_create_an_empire_desc: "Gensokyo was for the most part relatively peaceful. But the recent Breaking of the Barrier and the growth of heresy made Gensokyo a place of fighting and wars. If we want to bring peace back we have to create a powerful empire, which can represent an authority for Gensokyo and protect its people from religious and military threats."
 HKR_convert_japan_title: "Convert Japan"
 HKR_convert_japan_desc: "The history of Gensokyo is relatively young. Originally most of the inhabitants and even our religion are from our neighbor Japan, a country split in many small realms like ours. Much time has passed since then and the Japanese Shintoism and the Gensokyan Shintoism are now two completely different religions. Yet, if we show them the 'new' form of Shintoism, our Shintoism, they could save themselves from their heresy."
 HKR_enlighten_korea_title: "Convert Korea"
 HKR_enlighten_korea_desc: "With the conversion of the heart of Japan our religious influence in Asia grew immensely. But we are not done yet!

 HKR_challenge_the_dragon_title: "Challenge the Dragon"
 HKR_challenge_the_dragon_desc: "Confucian is an interesting religion: it promotes humanistic ideas and tolerance and it is filled with ancient traditions. But it can also become a danger for any realm, because of these ideas and tradition the state gets slowed down and can't make fast decisions. This problem is currently the cause of the Celestial Empire's fighting. They are slowed in their actions, yet they are still holding on their outdated mindsets. We should challenge them and save them from themselves!"

 HKR_monopolize_trade_to_gensokyo_desc: "The Breaking of the old Barrier isn't that bad: it allows now for interesting and profitable trading with the outer world. Yet, the foreign nations are still not trustworthy. If we monopolize every trade node which flows into Gensokyo we can better prepare for their possible plans of conquest. Ohh... and the profit we will make is nice too. Very nice."

 HKR_witch_trial_desc: "While their friendship is unquestionable, Marisa and Reimu still have their own realms to manage. Additionally, Marisa is eager to show Gensokyo her superiority in power over Reimu and while this is a commendable ambition, it is troublesome when we need the Forest's help. Reimu needs to show her that her skills are still unmatched!"
 HKR_build_shrine_prestige_title: "Restore Our Prestige"
 HKR_build_shrine_prestige_desc: "With the break of the Hakurei Barrier as well as appearances of heretic religions, the Hakurei shrine maiden's authority has been questioned. Many people see Reimu as a lazy girl, who doesn't care for humanity's safety. Additionally, religious new-comer like Sanae, Byakuren and Miko are earning all the donations, which should be in Hakurei possession. To end this vicious cycle, we must show our capability and reliability-- at least on the surface at the first step."

 HKR_religious_rivals_desc: "On the other side of the Youkai Mountain lives Sanae Kochiya, a outlandish and powerful colleague of Reimu. However, Sanae is a heretic and while their relationship isn't that bad, Sanae causes the lack of donors as her shrine gets all the people!

Although people there mostly follow our faith, they seldom go to our shrine and donate to us. We must show them the necessity of going to the shrine and open a direct smooth passage from human capital to our shrine."
 HKR_influence_human_capital_tt: "The reward is depending on how our relationship is with the owner of Human Capital. If we go the diplomatic way our reward will be more appealing for diplomacy while conquest / subjugation rewards us with military power.\n\nEvery non-[Root.Religion.GetName] province in §YHuman Capital§! or §YFarmlands§! owned by a [Root.Religion.GetName] country will be converted to §Y[Root.Religion.GetName]§!."

 HKR_back_to_the_past_desc: "Originally the Hakurei clan as well as Reimu Hakurei used to live in the northern part of Gensokyo. However, times have changed and the Clan moved to the more fertile and strategically important south so the resources were assured for a reformation of the Hakurei Shinto with the Danmaku system. But some people from the north didn't like this decision and remained \"Hakurei Traditional\" - lead by Meira, an old challenger of Reimu. Meira claimed to become the next, better Hakurei miko. We should teach her that a Hakurei miko's authority is not easily claimed!"

 HKR_defeat_the_scarlet_devil_title: "Defeat the Scarlet Devil"
 HKR_defeat_the_scarlet_devil_desc: "Remilia Scarlet is a weird person - even for Gensokyan standards. While her nature as a vampire suggests only bad things for humans and our realm, her behavior is in complete contrast to it as she rarely even interact with humans.\nStill, Remilia has the title of the \"Scarlet Devil\" and we heard that she plans on militarizing the fairies working for her.

Because of that we should focus on expanding our trade influence so we can buy a nice gift for Aunn in the open market of Gensokyo."
 HKR_origins_of_the_hakurei_clan_title: "Study the Origins"
 HKR_origins_of_the_hakurei_clan_desc: "For such an important country like ours it is important to be aware of our origins and the history we have made in Gensokyo. Our shrine maiden Reimu has no problems to remember, but even then she needs a person of history and religion to remind her to meditate about the past and to reflect."
 HKR_touhou_2_title: "March on Reimaden"
 HKR_touhou_2_desc: "While meditating about the past our good Shrine Maiden Reimu remembered that she left the ancient, powerful Yin-Yang Orbs in Reimaden, the home of the vengeful spirit Mima - and she will not give them back easily. It will take some political finesse as well as a big army to show her strength to get Mima returning the Yin-Yang Orbs back to Reimu.\nOr we could just march into Reimaden ourselves and take the orbs from Mima."
 HKR_touhou_3_title: "The Okazaki Reform"
 HKR_touhou_3_desc: "Back in the days when our realm was still in the North, we had contact with people, who claim to be from the future. Their leader is a Professor called Yumemi Okazaki. Despite the issues she has caused for Reimu, the technology and the ideas of stress management helped her significantly.\nBut times have changed and with that the memories of Okazaki's reforms. We should try to get in contact with the Probability Space Hypervessel again."
 HKR_touhou_4_title: "Re-Acquire the Dream Lotus"
 HKR_touhou_4_desc: "Reimu collected special dream items during the Lotus Land Story Incident, which she later used to defeat Yuuka. Although Reimu has lost this artifact it is lost in time. All we have to do is convincing Yuuka to give it back to Reimu..."
 HKR_touhou_5_title: "Journey to Makai"
 HKR_touhou_5_desc: "After meditating and acquire so many artifacts from the time of the Hakurei Tradition, Reimu has decided to visit the place of her last battle before the great Spell Card reform: to Makai!\nEven though the relationship between Shinki and Reimu is a lot better now, the scars of the near-death experience in Makai still exist."

 HKR_sell_land_to_the_estates_title: "[Root.GetName] and the Estates"
 HKR_sell_land_to_the_estates_desc: "Usually, the goal of an absolute ruler is to control all of the crownland for themselves and being the head for all decisions of the state. But these are not usual times here in Gensokyo. Due to the curse of the Donation Box collecting of donations has proven pointless anyway. So instead we should focus on earning some money by selling the crownland."
 HKR_sell_land_to_the_estates_tt: "If we decide to sell crown land to the estates we will get '§YRevoked Donations§!' for §Y20 years§!, giving the following effects:\nMonthly Autonomy Change: §G-0.10§!\nNational Unrest: §G-1.0§!\nProduction Efficiency: §G+10.0%§!\n\nOtherwise we will get '§YDonations for the Estates§!' for §Y20 years§!, giving the following effects:\nNational Tax Modifier: §G+10.0%§!\n[Root.GetClergyName] Loyalty Equilibrium: §G+10.0%§!\n[Root.GetBurghersName] Loyalty Equilibrium: §G+10.0%§!\n[Root.GetNobilityName] Loyalty Equilibrium: §G+10.0%§!"
 HKR_build_connections_title: "Build Connections"
 HKR_build_connections_desc: "It is no secret that our realm is not particularly in a good financial spot. Donations are vanishing, economical position is weak and we are surrounded by potential enemies meaning there is hardly an expansion opportunity for more money. To solve this issue we need to focus on alternative sources of income. We should build some connections with the local shrine maidens. Maybe they know of some jobs for us."
 HKR_youkai_hunter_title: "Youkai Exterminator"
 HKR_youkai_hunter_desc: "Our shrine maidens have reported that some youkai were going mad lately near Human Capital. Usually Byakuren or Keine would take care of them, but they have been busy too lately, so the job is now ours to do. But at least we got a good payment promised from the humans."
 HKR_youkai_hunter_tt: "Either own the provinces §YHuman Capital§!, §YLingering Snow Road§! and §YTewi's Rabbit Hole§! or exterminated mindless youkai for their province owners with the '§YExterminate Wild Youkai§!' diplomatic action."
 HKR_explore_eastern_indian_ocean_title: "Explore the Indian Ocean"
 HKR_explore_eastern_indian_ocean_desc: "The Barrier is lost and it is uncertain if we will ever manage to restore it to protect Gensokyo. However, we shouldn't grief about the lost and instead try to make the best out of it. Rumors tell that in the west there might be some valuable gold and silver sources - and pure gold and silver do not vanish like donations. We should explore the sea beyond."
 HKR_explore_eastern_indian_ocean_tt: "Discover the §YIndiean Ocean§!."
 HKR_create_trade_colonies_title: "[Root.GetAdjective] Trade Colonies"

 HKR_produce_your_own_gold_desc: "The Outworld is place to many gold and silver sources and while our beloved Shrine Maiden would love to take them all for our realm, we don't have the logistic nor the manpower to handle this.

 FOM_beyond_the_barrier_desc: "The Hakurei Barrier is a great shield which protects the youkai from the Outside. But in recent times it has cracked and its influence over Gensokyo vanished slowly. Astonishingly the youkai don't seem to be affected by this and continue their lives just normally... but for us it means the perfect opportunity to explore the Outside and its treasures!"
 FOM_discover_india_title: "Discover India"

 FOM_discover_europe_desc: "The great magician Alice Margatroid once told us the origin of the witches: a continent called Europe in the far west.

 FOM_friendship_with_reimu_desc: "Reimu and Marisa are good friends since their youth. When both became leaders of their own realms the friendship is still strong, but it isn't an official thing. We should improve our relations with the Hakurei Clan."
 FOM_breach_to_the_lake_title: "Get access to the Misty Lake"
 FOM_breach_to_the_lake_desc: "In the Misty Lake lies an island, which holds the infamous Scarlet Devil Mansion. The mansion has a huge library filled with magical tomes useful for our nation. However, some of those books are not easy to transport and won't survive a long flight. Due to this we need a direct access to the lake - and the Fairy Lands or the Youkai Forest would give this access perfectly."

Our realm already has a decent doll army, but we need materials to maintain and to expand our doll army. The Bamboo Forest in the east has a huge amount of materials we need to create more dolls.

 FOM_get_full_access_to_voile_library_title: "Voile, the Magic Library"
 FOM_get_full_access_to_voile_library_desc: "In the Scarlet Mansion there's a huge library full of magical tomes, books with ancient knowledge and even some forbidden writings. Usually Marisa could always 'borrow' some of these books but with the recent events everyone in Gensokyo became more tense and Marisa has lost her access to the library. Perhaps it is time to change our method: instead of borrowing the books we annex the library and with it the Scarlet Devil Mansion directly to our realm."
 FOM_rinnosukes_shop_title: "Rinnosuke's Shop"
 FOM_rinnosukes_shop_desc: "If there is good price, we are glad to pay money for books and materials too. In the north next to the Human Capital there's Kourindou, or better known as the shop of Rinnosuke Morichika. Rinnosuke is an expert in identifying the true value of treasures we loot and pays us a good amount of money, but the people of the Human Capital started to isolate themselves, which makes trading with Rinnosuke difficult. If we however integrate his shop into our realm nobody can stop this profitable relationship."
 FOM_unite_gensokyos_humans_title: "Unite the Gensokyans"
 FOM_unite_gensokyos_humans_desc: "While some magicians are born as magical youkai, most of the witches and mages are or were humans, which means that our realm is bound to the Gensokyojin. But Gensokyo houses many threats and it is a dangerous place for normal people. It is our duty to protect these people from all youkai dangers and integrate as many as possible into our glorious realm."
 FOM_establish_the_youkai_labrority_title: "The Youkai Laboratory"
 FOM_establish_the_youkai_labrority_desc: "With the additional ingredients from both the Youkai Forest and the Bamboo Forest and the knowledge from Scarlet Devil Mansion's library it may be now possible to brew a new Hourai Elixir. This Elixir has the ability to grant its consumer immortality, but it is lost and all knowledge about that were kept secret - until now. According to Eirin's notes and the books from the Voile Library the Elixir can only be brewed on a place where the air is extremely thin. One of these places is the Youkai Mountain in Gensokyo. We should establish a laboratory there."
 FOM_results_of_magic_and_technology_title: "Magic and Technology"
 FOM_results_of_magic_and_technology_desc: "The lab is finished, but the environment doesn't satisfy the requirements for the Elixir - even though it is the mountain with the thinnest air! Fortunately, there are people who could help us out: the Kappa in the west have advanced technology, which they use for incredible things like sucking air from the environment, but they're completely unorganized and until they find the machines we need we would've already died from age.\nAlternatively we can hijack the space vessel of Okazaki. Her technology is on par with those of the kappa, but she won't give it to us on her own. Either way, we need to take control over either realm and reorganize them for our purpose."
 FOM_train_the_doll_army_title: "Train the Magician Army"
 FOM_train_the_doll_army_desc: "The Forest of Magic is - as the name suggests - a giant forest area surrounded by all types of possible enemies: vampires from the lake, an ominous youkai hag in the south and crazed immortals in the east.

 FOM_eliminate_the_yuuka_threat_desc: "Yuuka Kazami, mistress over the Sunflower Plains, looks like a normal, nice woman, but she is one of the most powerful and dangerous beings on Gensokyo.

We should deal with the threat of her realm immediately if we want to secure the survival of our realm."
 FOM_overthrow_mima_title: "Ghosts from the Past"
 FOM_overthrow_mima_desc: "There is an ancient ghost in the north. This ghost is nobody but Mima herself, the teacher of many magicians and witches - her most well known apprentice was Marisa Kirisame. According to Marisa, Mima is... a difficult person and master, but her controversial teaching methods worked. However someday she disappeared without any reason, but now she is back and proclaims an \"empire\" on Gensokyo and has built a large undead army. It is unknown what her plan is nor if she is sane, but it is better when we strike now instead of waiting for the answer."

 FOM_annex_makai_title: "Makai, the Magic Realm"
 FOM_annex_makai_desc: "Just like Marisa, Alice was trained by an ancient master of magic too. In her case the old goddess Shinki, master of Makai, was her teacher and, similar to Mima, Shinki used rather strict teaching methods. Now Shinki watches over her realm which contains dangerous miasma and raw magic.\nAlice grew up there under the care of Shinki. Years have passed since Alice left her old home of Makai, but she is still a legitimate Makaian and the closest relative to Shinki, which gives Alice a justified claim on the throne of Makai... and its plentiful doll workshops."

 FOM_defeat_shinki_title: "Shinki, Master of Dolls"
 FOM_defeat_shinki_desc: "While the throne of Makai is a certain power boost to our own power, it is not our only target in this region. Shinki, the very goddess who created this world and taught Alice the art of creating dolls, still lurks in the depths of her palace. Alice needs to meet with her in order to learn the highly advanced doll control techniques Shinki has developed, but she is a very stubborn goddess. The only way to convince her to help is by showing [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s superiority in a Danmaku Duel against her powered-up maiden Yumeko."

Although it is just because of her Gensokyo exists in the first place, her shenanigans are still a threat to everyone.

 FOM_take_control_over_the_shrine_desc: "The Hakurei Clan was always a close ally for us. While they guarded the religious and military safety of Gensokyo our realm grew. Now it is time for this Clan to hand their duties over to us and become a part of our mighty nation."

 FOM_create_an_empire_desc: "Gensokyo has changed. Since the destruction of the Hakurei Barrier and the exposing of Gensokyo to the Outside the relations between all the realms are more tense than ever and everyone seeks a victory over its neighbor.

 FOM_start_the_quest_title: "Hunt After Immortality"
 FOM_start_the_quest_desc: "With both threats from Yuuka and Yukari removed and with the establishment of the laboratory on Youkai Mountain we can finally start our research for immortality - and with the notes from the Bamboo Forest and the books from the Scarlet Devil Mansion it may be possible to create a new Hourai Elixir, the potion of immortality..."

 FOM_magical_silk_shell_title: "Anti-Magical Silk Shell"
 FOM_magical_silk_shell_desc: "The Hourai Elixir may contain by the moment of its creation way too much magic for a human body to handle. We have to find a way to weaken the magic potential of the potion. Eirin used for her potion moon silk, but you can't find this on earth - or at least we thought it. Rumors tell that a special silk from the Bengal Delta absorbs water, fire effects and even physical hits. It is probably a story told by some crazed guru, but you never know..."

The Epic of Gilgamesh tells from Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, and his story how he seeks out for this herb to achieve immortality too.

 FOM_greek_fire_title: "Recreate the Greek Fire"
 FOM_greek_fire_desc: "One final ingredient is a \"flame, so hot it burns even on water, so alive it will never be extinguished\".

Due to the arcane powers of the forest this statue has become sentient and is today the person Narumi Yatadera, a skillful magician.\nShe is quite friendly towards Marisa and Alice, but she is hard to motivate to be more involved in the business of the Forest of Magic.

 FOM_byakurens_magic_desc: "Byakuren Hijiri might be a devout monk, but she is also a magician, who learnt the one or another trick from her friend Shinki! However, she is not too eager to share her spells with us as she thinks these scrolls should be used for the Buddhistic faith.\nTo our luck though, the Myouren Temple has seen a withdrawal from donations. She might be more willing to give one of her scrolls to us if we pay her a nice sum of Ducats.\nAlternatively, we could search them for ourself if we \"borrow\" some land of her realm."

 FOM_uniting_the_foresters_desc: "Rumia, Mystia and Wriggle all stood in front of Marisa and asked for one last favor for them: the unification of the great forest of Gensokyo. They claim that under the supervision of us magicians the youkai are living a so much better life. While Marisa is skeptical that the other youkai would be fond of becoming part of our great realm, she can't decline this wish.

 HIG_reorganize_the_shinigami_desc: "The shinigami are responsible for ferrying the souls to Higan in order for them to be judged. In theory that is.\nDue to the many privileges Komachi managed to get from Hecatia for the shinigami, the influx of new souls has come to a near standstill. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] respects free days and vacations, but their behavior is endangering the whole flow of the afterlife. We need to revoke their privileges!"

 HIG_improve_hells_infrastructure_desc: "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is not only the highest judge of the dead, but also the vice ruler of Hell. As such, it is our utter most priority to maintain and improve the infrastructure in Hell in order for keeping the sinners locked up and punished.\nBoth can be achieved relatively simple by constructing workshops, which serve as the prison cells for the damned, as well as their eternal torture as workforces."

 HIG_take_over_chireiden_title: "Take over Former Hell"
 HIG_take_over_chireiden_desc: "Former Hell was once our realm of operation. But due to the sheer overpopulation of evil spirits, demons and other creatures of the underworld, Higan needed to expand. Due to the bureaucratic issues, Eiki Shiki, Supreme Judge of Gensokyo, then decided to split Higan into two regions: Hell and Former Hell.\nWhile Higan was ruled by Eiki, Former Hell was under direct control of Hecatia. But the goddess preferred to have somebody else doing her work, and so she decided to drop the claim entirely, turning Former Hell into a battlefield between the satoris, the onis and the spirits.\n\nEventually, Satori Komeiji seized power over Former Hell and became its absolute ruler. Despite all these events, Former Hell still is sovereign territory of [Root.GetName]. We should remind Satori about that."

 HIG_side_with_a_shrine_maiden_desc: "Gensokyo is the target of many antagonistic forces, who try to to tip the balance of power to their favor by all means. These beings cause continental incidents, which bring only chaos and discord to the mortals and youkai alike. Fortunately, there are shrine maidens and religious heads, who resolve these incidents as fast as possible - most notably Reimu Hakurei.\nHowever, incidents are only one issue. The other is the utter religious chaos reigning in Gensokyo. We will have to side with one of the great religions if we want to bring unity to the continent."

 HIG_remove_tenshi_from_heaven_desc: "While it is our duty to govern Hell, the celestials inhabit Heaven and ensure its stability and well being. Usually, the yama don't interfere with the business of the celestials, but for reasons unknown to us, Tenshi Hinanawi has become the leader of Heavenly Realm. Her selfish and irresponsible nature is not only a liability to Heaven, but also a threat to Gensokyo as a whol!\nAlthough it is not the yama way to fiddle with the high heavens, it is still our duty as peacekeeper of Gensokyo to remove the threat Tenshi represents."

 HIG_handle_the_gang_wars_desc: "The eastern part of Hell is the well known Animal Realm, which is inhabited by the spirits of the deceased animals. For the most part, the Animal Realm has been ruled by three \"gangs\" which are ruled by the strongest.\nThe great Yamaxanadu has rarely reason to meddle with the strife of the Matriarchs. However, when when word reached Eiki that the gang leaders are enslaving the human spirits in order to create an army, as well as the involvement of a goddess to subdue the gang leaders, it became clear to our realm that Animal Realm needs to be governed by the yama instead of these animals."

Admittedly, she and the other two sages are responsible for the creation of Gensokyo in the first place, but neither of them saw it as necessary to regulate youkai society nor to enforce the laws these very sages have created in the first place.\nIt is time to teach humility and responsibility to the gap youkai."
 HIG_resolve_the_immortal_conflict_title: "The Immortal Rivals"
 HIG_resolve_the_immortal_conflict_desc: "Death is the fate of all living beings and a crucial part of the balance of the universe. Yet there are two rivals who defy the peace of death itself. Kaguya and Mokou are these mentioned immortal rivals, who kill each other on a daily basis. Due to their immortal status, there is no reason to lecture them in the first place - after all they will never reach the Grand Courtroom in the first place.\nThere is one issue though: their constant deaths irritate the shinigami of Higan. Whenever either of them gets slain, the shinigami get a notification through their senses, which results in their departure to obtain the new soul. When they reach the \"corpse\", however, they find a living, breathing immortal instead, wasting the shinigami's time. We have to end their daily brawls once and for all."

 HIG_take_over_the_road_of_liminality_title: "Connect the Road"
 HIG_take_over_the_road_of_liminality_desc: "The Road of Liminality is the crossroad between Gensokyo and Hell. As such, many spirits and ghosts as well as living beings pass this road. Eventually, the road has become a hub of trade between the living and the dead.\nBut not all merchants are coming to this place in good faith. We should seize control over this road and ensure that the scamming ghosts are sent back to hell."

 HIG_move_the_ministry_to_gensokyo_desc: "The Ministry of Right and Wrong is the political institution which is responsible for the government and administration of all dimensions of hell. It's also the organization, which creates the laws and rules which are used to judge a soul. The yama are direct subordinates of this ministry and our actions are the will of the 10 Kings of the Ministry.\nBut their influence was not meant to be forever. The 10 Kings are exceptional judges, but their economic judgment is severely lacking. Eventually, the kings pawned Higan and their other territories in Gensokyo to Hecatia. It is clear that the once mighty Ministry of Right and Wrong is a shell of what it once was. It is time to establish our Ministry!"

While we provide the Netherworld resources and protection, all the Spirit Princess did was threaten the balance of Gensokyo.

While she is technically the authority above the great Yamaxanadu, Hecatia prefers to spend her time to be the advisor of the Yamaxanadu instead.\nHowever, she has been on vacations, and has been seen lastly on the moon, where she helps a being of pure rage and fury to eradicate the lunarians. These vacations have now been going for literal decades, and there seems to be no sign of her returning to Higan. The time has come for Hecatia to finally return to Higan and retake her role as an important advisor of Hell."

 HIG_improve_the_sanzu_river_income_desc: "The Sanzu River is the mist-shrouded river that dead souls must cross in order to reach Higan, where they will await judgment. While only the dead can cross the river itself, the riverbank is a major attraction point for youkai, humans, living and undead alike.\nWe should develop the infrastructure of the riverbanks and establish a fort for the shinigami in order to protect the travelers on this place."
 HIG_establish_hig_fleet_title: "Fleet of the Judicator"
 HIG_establish_hig_fleet_desc: "Gensokyo has been separated from the Outworld ever since the creation of the Hakurei Barrier. This brought peace within the continent while also protecting it from the humans who were all too eager to set foot on Gensokyo. But as luck would have it, the barrier cracked and broke. Not only did this break the fragile peace within Gensokyo but it also made the Outworld aware of our existence. We should construct a fleet in order to protect our home from invaders."
 HIG_beyond_the_barrier_title: "Beyond the Barrier"
 HIG_beyond_the_barrier_desc: "Although our priority lies in the protection of Gensokyo, the Outworld still contains mysteries which are too compelling to us to be ignored.

 HIG_the_jizo_of_japan_title: "The Jizo of Japan"
 HIG_the_jizo_of_japan_desc: "All great Yamaxanadus used to be jizo statues, which gained enough faith to become sentient. These jizos then got selected by the Ten Kings in order to become the yama we know today.\nDue to the financial bankruptcy of the former Ten Kings, the Ministry of Right and Wrong fell in Hecatia's care. As a result, there has been a lack of new yamas to cover the exponential growth of the souls which need judgment. Hecatia promised to take care of it, but her eccentric nature makes her quite unreliable. It would be wise if we take matters in our own hands and get access to the greatest source of new jizos in Japan."
 HIG_the_way_of_buddhism_title: "The Way of Buddhism"
 HIG_the_way_of_buddhism_desc: "Many aspects of Gensokyan culture and religion have their roots in Buddhism. Many of the laws and rules we have to use for our judgments are based on Buddhist virtues.

We have to traverse the desert and push even further west."
 HIG_lecture_the_bad_title: "Lecture the Evil"
 HIG_lecture_the_bad_desc: "The rulers of the different realms of Gensokyo are ambitious.

 HIG_appoint_competent_executor_title: "The Astral Executor"
 HIG_appoint_competent_executor_desc: "Long before the creation of Former Hell, the Ten Kings held territory in Gensokyo which is today known as \"Old Hell\". As it was a time long before the first Yamaxanadu, there is not much known about this area nor when the switch from Old Hell to Former Hell happened. For all we know is that Old Hell is now owned by an ancient protector of Hell: the Astral Knight Konngara.\nIt just happens to be that we are looking for an Executor who shall embody the long Arm of Justice. Konngara would be an excellent choice for this role."

 HIG_afterlive_of_the_deserts_desc: "Long before the Islam emerged in the Middle East, the ancient Kingdom of Egypt worshipped many more than one god. In their pantheon there is one goddess in particular who strikes similarities in our kind: the ancient goddess Maat. Unfortunately, the Roman and later the Muslim conquest of the Middle East ensured the destruction of all the writings about the ancient Egyptian deities. But not all is lost!

 HIG_the_christian_afterworld_desc: "In the ancient Greek faith, the god Zeus was the king of the gods and as such he was also the Celestial Judge above everyone. While his style of judging is rather... radical, his way of dealing the punishment ensured that his word was law.\nAccording to legends of the Outworld, there is still a hidden temple dedicated to him in Athens.

Due to economical misconduct, the Ten Kings were eventually forced to pawn their territory and the Ministry of Right and Wrong to Hecatia. They stayed in China and continued on as usual, though they are now only judging the souls of the Celestial Empire. It is time to track these petty kings and re-integrate them into the Ministry."
 HIG_yama_influence_in_south_east_asia_title: "The Temples of Java"
 HIG_yama_influence_in_south_east_asia_desc: "The island of Java houses great temples for both the Buddhism and the Hinduism. Religion itself is not really a matter of the yama, but Buddhism and Hinduism are special: both faiths played a key role in the origin of the first Japanese jizo, and later the first yama. In order to improve ourselves, we need to understand our origins and the virtues and sins of the religions of our ancestors.\nThe province [2690.GetName] houses two of the most impressive temples of each of the religions. We should take permanent control over it and study the temples."

 HIG_the_concept_of_dharma_desc: "According to the inscriptions in the temples of [2090.GetName], the high judges have their origin in the Dharmic faiths of India. The Yama, also translated as \"the King\", was the Deity of Death and judged the souls of the deceased. Of course there are differences between the Japanese-Gensokyan yama and the Indian yama, but the core is the same.\nIt would be wise to study the Hindu faith for our benefit."

 MIM_old_hakurei_desc: "The Hakurei Clan used to be one of our closest neighbors. Although the relations between Mima and Reimu were mostly one-sided teasing, the spirits of [Root.GetName] still had their deep respect for the shrine maiden. This changed, however, when Reimu and the Hakurei Clan have decided to move to the south of Gensokyo. Now all what remains in the former Hakurei Shrine is a lonely samurai, who tries to live up to Reimu's legacy.\nThis pathetic human has nothing to her. We should... liberate the old Hakurei Shrine, and put it under our own administration."
 MIM_cult_of_mima_title: "Found the Cult of Mima"
 MIM_cult_of_mima_desc: "The faith of the Hakurei Tradition is an old one which uses influential and famous figures of early Gensokyan history as icons. One of them is our mistress Mima herself. However, the victory over Makai has shown us that Mima is worth to be much more; worth to have a cult which outshines the followers of these petty gods!"
 MIM_contact_with_marisa_title: "The lost Apprentice"
 MIM_contact_with_marisa_desc: "Before the Hakurei schism, our great mistress Mima used to have an apprentice who followed every order of the vengeful spirit. This apprentice, Marisa Kirisame, left our realm, and followed Reimu Hakurei to the south.\nMarisa expected to be lifted of her duty as Mima's apprentice. This can't be any further away from the truth. It is time to reconnect with Marisa, and remind her of her duties she has!"

 MIM_the_new_gensokyo_desc: "In the past only the north of Gensokyo was populated while the rest of the continent was inhabited by feral youkai, restless spirits and the one or another village. This has changed, however, when the great Hakurei schism happened. Fast forward to today, and now Gensokyo is filled with so many newcommers. It is clear that the old era is over, and it is time for us to move on and adapt.\nWe should test the strength of this new generation of shrine maidens, witches, youkai and what not, and make them our obedient subjects!"

Might as well free her from her miserable life as an heir of some backwater country, and bring her to the grand court of Mistress Mima herself."
 MIM_capture_ruukoto_title: "Capture Ruukoto"
 MIM_capture_ruukoto_desc: "Flesh is weak. Maids made of flesh have their purpose, but in the end they tire. They need to rest. They are weak.\nBut there is one maid, which never tires; never complains. A nuclear-powered robot maid, Ruukoto, is exactly what our realm needs for all the hard labor. It's unclear where she might be now, perhaps we need to look in all the areas associated with Reimu and Yumemi."
 MIM_capture_sakuya_title: "Capture Sakuya"
 MIM_capture_sakuya_desc: "Various stories coming to us from mainland Gensokyo are telling about an elegant maid from Scarlet Devil Mansion who mastered time manipulation, Sakuya Izayoi. It is said that she hunts people when her master wishes so. A loyal dog like the hound of the Scarlet Devil would be perfect for the court of Reimaden."
 MIM_capture_yumeko_title: "Capture Yumeko"
 MIM_capture_yumeko_desc: "Yumeko is the personal maid of the goddess Shinki, and is known for her endless loyalty and swordsmanship. Unlike the Silver Dog of the Scarlet Devil, Yumeko is a very honorable person who does not backstab her targets in the middle of the night. Instead, Yumeko throws her blades in face-to-face combat. She will be nice addition to the Maids of Reimaden!"
 MIM_capture_vivit_title: "Capture VIVIT"
 MIM_capture_vivit_desc: "This one is a bit tricky. The only information we have are questionable references in some of Yumemi's papers regarding other parallel worlds. According to them, VIVIT is a combat maid-type robot from future powered by mysterious cactus energy. It may be rather hard to find her in this world, but the papers mentioned she was looking for a Holy Grail.\nAccording to another report from Yumemi, the Holy Grail seems to be located in a ruined city near Jerusalem.

It is our goal to capture these maids, \"save\" them from their current masters and bring them into our mistress' care, where they can serve a power which utilizes their powers to their fullest.\nThough, some of them will not come voluntarily, but what are a few unhappy maids to the glory of the Maids of Reimaden?"

 MIM_capture_alice_desc: "During our last visit in Makai, our mistress Mima encountered a girl called Alice Margatroid. She tried to defend Shinki from Mima, but of course she got defeated. After a failed rematch, Mima forced Alice to serve as a maid. Although our mistress taught Alice the wonders of magic, the girl couldn't appreciate our mistress' hospitality. Eventually, she vanished.\nHowever, after a lont time we finally found a track of her again! Alice has been in a forest, which is controlled by a renegade apprentice of Mima. We should march into the Forest of Magic, and reclaim the evasive maid!\nWe also should keep an eye on the Margatroid province too in case Alice tries to evade us again."
 MIM_the_astral_knight_title: "The Astral Knight"
 MIM_the_astral_knight_desc: "The Astral Knight Konngara is one of the few individuals who stayed in the north when the schism happened.

 MIM_defeat_shinki_title: "The Goddess of Makai"
 MIM_defeat_shinki_desc: "Shinki is the goddess of Makai, and an old acquaintance of our mistress. Before the schism, Shinki let an army of demons invade the Hakurei Shrine. Our mistress cares little about the life of humans, but back then the Hakurei Shrine was also her home. Naturally, the spirit travelled to Makai and defeated Shinki single handedly.\nWhile the defeat has been humiliating for the goddess in the past, the threat of Makai still lingers. Makai must fall if we want to avenge our mistress!"

 MIM_engines_of_destruction_title: "Engines of Destruction"
 MIM_engines_of_destruction_desc: "Not everyone in Gensokyo uses magic to accomplish their goals. Some are using more...  brute forces. Rika and the Panzerholics in the south of us are such people, who construct machines for the purpose of war.
